Hours&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot;, an

questions, problems or just to work on beginner projects with someone
who can give a hand within reach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It probably wasn't a success, though it definitely wasn't a disaster. I
only sent out the announcement to my former students, and several people
were really excited about the idea though only one confirmed he would
come. And indeed, although my opt-in &amp;quot;Python Office Hours&amp;quot; list now has
a few more names in it, on Thursday there was only me and the one
student, so not quite the successful evening turnout-wise. However, we
had a very long discussion about the project he wants to do, how to go
about cutting down the design into different Python projects manageable
for a newcomer to the language, to a level that we wouldn't have been
able to discuss had there been other students around. So this wasn't a
wasted evening, although we probably went into more depth than I was
thinking or hoping for! That's the advantage of showing up, you can get
more than you bargained for :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will do a few more of these office hours. I think maybe people will
get moving in their projects and/or learning if they know it's a regular
occurrence. I'll likely expand the reach too, though I'm a bit concerned
people will misread and show up expecting more (or any kind of)
structure -- as I discovered a couple of courses ago, people read an
email and focus on one keyword at the expense of what the actual course
or event is about! Everyone ends up disappointed and frustrated, so I'll
make sure to pen that email carefully, and work at learning which words
to bold for &lt;strong&gt;maximum&lt;/strong&gt; effect :]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've decided to try something different and will be holding Python
&amp;quot;office hours&amp;quot; in &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.tog.ie"&gt;Tog&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday evening. It's

&lt;p&gt;I've decided to try something different and will be holding Python
&amp;quot;office hours&amp;quot; in &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.tog.ie"&gt;Tog&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday evening. It's
not really a secret but I'm not exactly advertising it either. I sent an
email to my former students for Thursday's test run, and depending on
how it goes I may hold these regularly and be more vocal about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is it going to be about? This is sort of a follow-up to an intro
course, for people who have a project but can still get stuck and could
use some guidance. Or for people who want to reinforce&amp;nbsp; their knowledge
of Python/get up to speed by doing exercises, with someone nearby to
give a hand if needed. Basically it's for people who want to do their
own thing, with the knowledge that if things don't work there's someone
who should be able to help in the room, rather than hours of frustration
in sight. Or that's the idea! This isn't a course, I won't be teaching
or lecturing or erm talking that much. If no one needs help I'll be
working on my own stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I look forward to seeing how it goes. Drop by Tog (
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.tog.ie/location"&gt;map&lt;/a&gt; ) anytime between 6.30 and 9pm this
Thursday if you're interested! And feel free to drop me a note (see
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.jpichon.net/about/"&gt;About&lt;/a&gt; page) if you're curious but not
sure if it's a good fit for you.&lt;/p&gt;
