task&lt;/a&gt;
for the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://p2pu.org/en/groups/how-to-teach-webcraft-and-programming-to-free-range-students/"&gt;Teaching
webcraft&lt;/a&gt;
course is about making up profiles for people we're hoping to help. The
couple of biographies that follow do not cover it all, but should still
be a fair sample :-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;* * *&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jessie&lt;/strong&gt; is a high school student, and although she thinks about it
often, what she wants to do after her final year still very much depends
on what catches her interest the most any given week. She navigates the
web effortlessly, and hangs out online in all the social networks her
friends are into. She never really considered programming as something
she could learn, but when presented with the opportunity to join an
intro course she thinks maybe there she'll learn enough code to be able
to personalise her blog, and make it look unique and more interactive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This course will teach Jessie how to create her first program, and that
programming is more similar to puzzle solving than inputting number in
Excel to do sums like in the ICT class. Perhaps something worth
exploring further...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;*&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jon&lt;/strong&gt; is working hard at his PhD thesis in social sciences. He has a
lot of statistics to parse and go through every day, results of
experiments to reproduce before building on them and so on. He has a
dozen of Excel spreadsheets set up with insane macros that save him a
lot of time, but still wastes many hours manually inputting data taken
from websites or articles. He's hoping learning to program will enable
him to spend less time on drudge work and more time exploring the
interesting questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This course will teach Jon how to automate more of his experimental
work, and in the process make him realise there are other areas where
some scripting would make writing his dissertation more efficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;*&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paula&lt;/strong&gt; doesn't consider herself a power user, but she knows the
keyboard shortcuts for every application she uses, is familiar with the
file system layout of her computer (and learnt what a file system is)
thanks to a couple of misadventures clicking on interesting looking
icons, and is known to her friends and colleagues as the go-to person
whenever a computer misbehaves. Though she doesn't plan on making a
career out of it, she is curious to gain an understanding of what's
under the hood of all these applications she uses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This course will teach Paula the fundamental steps and &amp;quot;bricks&amp;quot; that
every program is made of, and help her understand why bugs happen and
what makes them difficult to eradicate. Maybe putting together a short
script to randomly assign secret Santas for the next Christ Kindle
wouldn't be too hard, though...&lt;/p&gt;

on &amp;quot;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://p2pu.org/en/groups/how-to-teach-webcraft-and-programming-to-free-range-students/"&gt;How to teach webcraft and programming to free-range
students&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot;
taught by Greg Wilson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at the initial comments on the course it's possible I
misunderstood what &amp;quot;free-range students&amp;quot; means ; from the course
description I took it to mean teaching in various non-traditional
settings, but it might actually be specifically about online learning
(?). It's fine, the general concepts of &amp;quot;what is good teaching&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;how
people learn&amp;quot; and how to encourage independent learning will be helpful
anyway. :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="first-task"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;First task&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://p2pu.org/en/groups/how-to-teach-webcraft-and-programming-to-free-range-students/content/getting-started-some-things-to-read-some-things-to-think-about/"&gt;Our first
task&lt;/a&gt;
is to take a look at the IES (Institution of Educational Sciences)
report on &amp;quot;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://ies.ed.gov/ncee/wwc/practiceguide.aspx?sid=1"&gt;Organizing Instruction and Study to Improve Student
Learning&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot;
(summarised in &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://software-carpentry.org/2011/12/organizing-instruction-and-study-to-improve-student-learning/"&gt;Greg's post
here&lt;/a&gt;)
and compare their recommendations to our own approach to teaching
programming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the record, I teach sporadically in my own time, to small groups of
6 to 10 complete beginners, usually-but-not-always adults, in the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.tog.ie"&gt;local
hackerspace&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="recommendation-1-space-learning-over-time"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Recommendation 1: Space learning over time.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Arrange to review key elements of course content after a delay of
several weeks to several months after initial presentation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a 5 or 6 weeks-long course, this can be difficult. However, most
concepts do build on top on each other: once learnt, they will be used
every week from then on. The later concepts could benefit from regular
review, but by then the course is about finished unfortunately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="recommendation-2-interleave-worked-example-solutions-with-problem-solving-exercises"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Recommendation 2: Interleave worked example solutions with problem-solving exercises.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Have students alternate between reading already worked solutions and
trying to solve problems on their own.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the 2nd session of the course, I start by showing a short, working
program to the class and ask them to think about what it could be doing,
(trying to) figure out as a group what could be its purpose. This sounds
more like review though, as it reuses the previous concepts. The report
also reads that &lt;strong&gt;alternating&lt;/strong&gt; working examples + exercises is hugely
important. &amp;quot;Worked example solutions&amp;quot; should go into much more details
than what I've been doing as well (showing intermediate steps, rather
than only the final solution).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="recommendation-3-combine-graphics-with-verbal-descriptions"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Recommendation 3: Combine graphics with verbal descriptions.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Combine graphical presentations (e.g., graphs, figures) that illustrate
key processes and procedures with verbal descriptions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can't say that I'm really doing this. I'm projecting code, sometimes
working out solutions in front of the class but this isn't particularly
graphical. I'm not sure how to do this either. It actually reminds me of
the approach to learning that Sean O'Leary mentioned in his talk on
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://sess.ie/resources/science-differentiation-action"&gt;differentiated
learning&lt;/a&gt; at
the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.jpichon.net/blog/2011/05/reimaging-learning/"&gt;Reimagining Learning
conference&lt;/a&gt;,
where he told us about adding visual cues to quizzes and concepts to
help dyslexic learners and students with a more visual approach.
Although useful, this doesn't exactly match the IES report
recommendation which advocates making sure the graphical element is
directly relevant to the concept being taught.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="recommendation-4-connect-and-integrate-abstract-and-concrete-representations-of-concepts"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Recommendation 4: Connect and integrate abstract and concrete representations of concepts.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Connect and integrate abstract representations of a concept with
concrete representations of the same concept.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report explains that students gain an understanding faster when
using concrete examples, but then don't know how to transfer the
knowledge to new problems ; while students who learn the concept
abstractly struggle more initially but are then more flexible with the
knowledge. The report advocates mixing up both, which I'm not doing or
not doing well as my students tend to have trouble reusing previous
concepts to break down more intricate problems on their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="recommendation-5-use-quizzing-to-promote-learning"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Recommendation 5: Use quizzing to promote learning.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Use quizzing with active retrieval of information at all phases of the
learning process to exploit the ability of retrieval directly to
facilitate long-lasting memory traces.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5a. Use pre-questions to introduce a new topic.&lt;/strong&gt; I don't do this. I
wonder if &amp;quot;previewing&amp;quot; an unknown programming concept would help
learning, or increase confusion. It'd definitely need to solve a
concrete problem, ideally that we encountered in the previous session.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5b. Use quizzes to re-expose students to key content.&lt;/strong&gt; I don't do
this either. (Actually, reading on the report, presenting small programs
and asking students to figure out what it does may be considered a quiz,
as it encourages them to retrieve previously learnt material). It's
interesting, and I wonder how to apply it to teaching practical
programming while keeping the questions short and meaningful (maybe tiny
programs with missing bits, with a multiple choice as to what to fill
the blank with?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="recommendation-6-help-students-allocate-study-time-efficiently"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Recommendation 6: Help students allocate study time efficiently.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Assist students in identifying what material they know well, and what
needs further study, by teaching children how to judge what they have
learned.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6a. Teach students how to use delayed judgements of learning to
identify content that needs further study.&lt;/strong&gt; I'm not doing this, except
perhaps brutally when giving exercises that a student doesn't know how
to solve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6b. Use tests and quizzes to identify content that needs to be
learned.&lt;/strong&gt; This advises giving a quiz, written or oral, could be done as
a game, right after presenting new material, so students can assess what
they actually do remember. I don't do this. Considering most of my
students don't make the time for homework or studying at home, I don't
know if this would be very effective on its own. Or perhaps it would
highlight that they do need to study outside of the class and encourage
them to do so...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="recommendation-7-ask-deep-explanatory-questions"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Recommendation 7: Ask deep explanatory questions.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Use instructional prompts that encourage students to pose and answer
“deep-level” questions on course material. These questions enable
students to respond with explanations and supports deep understanding of
taught material.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do a tiny bit of this when I introduce a new concept or explain what
an existing program does, but not very deeply, nor involving the class
enough (it can be tough generating discussion!). Some of the suggestions
include having students think aloud, then comment and build on each
other's understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
