add-on. Normally the add-on adds the readings automatically when creating new
cards, but lately that was failing with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
An error occurred in an add-on.
Please post on the add-on forum:

Exception: Please ensure your Linux system has 32 bit binary support.
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first I thought, meh, the rest works fine, and usually I don't need to add
the readings for &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; word anyway, just the one that's new to me in the
sentence so that shouldn't take too much time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took me a few months to realise I wasn't creating new cards anymore, just
plopping them into a list of &amp;quot;cards to create when I have the time someday.&amp;quot;
Whoops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solution, found via a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?pid=1681613#p1681613"&gt;ArchLinux thread&lt;/a&gt; is also dead simple:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
$ sudo dnf install libstdc++.i686 # Note the i686, that's the important bit!
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Better get on with that word list now.&lt;/p&gt;

Japanese, however most of the Gnome menus remained in English even after
switching the System Language altogether, logging out etc. Another
profile on the laptop shows the menus for Activities, etc in Japanese
just fine so it wasn't a missing package. I found the following in
~/.profile, which seems a bit heavy-handed but does do the trick. For
future reference:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
LANG=&amp;quot;ja_JP.UTF-8&amp;quot;
LANGUAGE=&amp;quot;ja_JP.UTF-8&amp;quot;

&lt;p&gt;Note on restarting X one is asked if they want to change the names for
the default folders like Documents, etc. Personally I find it makes
using the CLI a pain and don't recommend it.&lt;/p&gt;

starting with a couple of months of studying the language some more. I
landed about 2 weeks ago. The school put me at a slightly higher level
than I had dared to hope and I am now learning new words, new
expressions, new nuances every day and generally having a tremendous
time :) I'm exactly where I want to be, doing and learning what I want
to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm experimenting with &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/132254976&amp;#64;N03/"&gt;posting pictures on
Flickr&lt;/a&gt; as I go, we'll
see how that works out!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, note for future-self and other folks who are about to travel with
a cold: the so-called &amp;quot;ear planes&amp;quot; work great to avoid painful ear pain
on descent. I put them about 1h30 before landing on the second flight
and it was painless, quite a contrast with the previous flight 10 hours
earlier. Nasal spray helps a bit for comfort too.&lt;/p&gt;

Sapporo&lt;/a&gt;, as a great option
to get affordable housing for mediumish to longer stays in Japan. I
spent a month there in September.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="DK house front" src="https://www.jpichon.net/site_media/images/2014/dk_house.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They specialise in short-term accommodations, normally starting from 3
months but if you want to stay for a shorter time like I did, you can
get in touch with them in advance and ask if it's ok. Despite sending my
queries in both Japanese and English, they replied in English only so
you don't need to be overly concerned about the language if your
Japanese isn't up to snuff yet :-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The facilities are clean and the staff is always really helpful. As I
was staying only a few weeks I couldn't get a room with a private
bathroom, but it didn't turn out to be a problem. I never had to queue
for a shower. There's also a shared kitchen and a convenient laundry
room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rooms have a desk and a LAN port and I didn't have any major issues
with the Internet. As a backup I'd rented a &amp;quot;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.globaladvancedcomm.com/pocketwifi.html"&gt;pocket
wifi&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; and I was
glad to have it for network-intensive operations (ahem, devstack) or
when there was a bit too much contention. Also, there is no wireless in
the rooms. (If you're planning to spend a lot of time at that desk, you
may want to mentally prepare yourself for the fact that the chair was
not picked for its ergonomic qualities!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's some totally optional activities from time to time in the common
room, if you want to meet with the other residents. You're a few minutes
away from the tramway (市電) which leads you straight to the city centre
in 15 minutes, 3 konbinis (Lawson, Seven Eleven) and a super tasty ramen
place (てつや - I recommend the しょうゆ).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now if you're used to luxurious super comfortable hotel mattresses and
spacious rooms I suppose you may be disappointed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally I'm really happy with my experience and heartily recommend
the place :)&lt;/p&gt;

Fukuoka, Japan with the goal of expanding my knowledge of Japanese.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every weekday, I went to a language school,
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.genkijacs.com"&gt;GenkiJACS&lt;/a&gt;. On the first day, my level was
accurately evaluated through a written test and interview, and on the
same afternoon I was put into a small class (5 people, myself included)
with students at a similar level from all over the world. The lessons
were held entirely in Japanese, with students' chitchat also happening
in Japanese -- a lovely atmosphere :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Support from the staff, both by email during the preceding months and
during my stay, was top notch. The school also offers all sorts of
native language materials for students to borrow, though considering the
building was right above Mandarake, a manga/video games/DVD/etc shop, I
must say I mostly bought my own... :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stayed with a host family for the whole time, which was wonderful in
terms of language practice, making friends and experiencing varied
aspects of Japanese daily life. The perceived lack of independence made
me a bit twitchy at times though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concepts and vocabulary I learnt in and out of class have stuck well
so far -- the class format is very good, with lots of reviewing after a
new concept is introduced. In the end though, 2 weeks isn't enough time
to acquire that much new knowledge and I mostly treat the experience as
a very thorough level check. There are lots of conversations I had I
didn't realise were within my grasp. Because Japanese people are often
reluctant or unable to speak English (but always so nice and helpful!),
I had plenty of opportunities to practice in varied contexts and I'm now
a lot less shy about speaking in Japanese.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With only 2 weeks, unfortunately there was little time for tourism,
though what I saw of Fukuoka City (Canal City, Kushida shrine and many
other temples, Oohori Park, my local yakitori izakaya and kappazushi...)
and the Fukuoka Prefecture (Dazaifu, Abura yama...) was delightful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Definitely a wonderful experience. Study-wise, it was good for building
confidence and boosting motivation. It was also good for cheaply
acquiring plenty of contents in the language for practice... and making
new friends! :)&lt;/p&gt;
