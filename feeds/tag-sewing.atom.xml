&amp;quot;sew-along&amp;quot; adventure targeted at beginners. My sewing skills are
limited to sort-of-putting back together fallen buttons and er that's
about it, so this should be an interesting experience!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.blogforbettersewing.com/2010/11/next-sew-along-plus-little-blogging.html"&gt;This is the first post from Gertie about
this&lt;/a&gt;,
the person leading the sew along project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.blogforbettersewing.com/2010/11/sew-along-fabric-choices-from-aunt-bea.html"&gt;The second one is about getting
fabrics&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Truth is, I am fairly lost right from the first post. There's a lot of
vocabulary I'm missing, other things I plain don't understand and
because I'm not familiar with the field it's difficult for me to
visualise what's supposed to happen, even after reading up on the words
and concepts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thankfully &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://chebe.dreamwidth.org/35344.html"&gt;Cheryl knows a thing or two about
sewing&lt;/a&gt; (all that Lilypad
awesomeness must be good practice!) and didn't freak out when I called
her &amp;quot;Mentor&amp;quot; so she'll be helping :) Already learning a lot from &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://chebe.dreamwidth.org/36166.html"&gt;her
post about measures and
fabrics&lt;/a&gt;, will do the
measuring thing later on this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ordered &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.sewbox.co.uk/pattern-packs/clothing-pattern-packs/colette-patterns-1013-crepe-dress-pattern-pack.html"&gt;the pattern and fabric from
Sewbox&lt;/a&gt;
in the UK (not received yet). I may shop around Dublin to find a nicely
coloured fabric for the tie, though I'm not quite sure where to look for
something like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The actual sew along adventure begins on December 6th, until then it's
about getting the pattern and fabric. There will likely be impromptu
meetings in &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.tog.ie"&gt;Tog&lt;/a&gt; to work on this, you're very
welcome to join in if interested! (We can make all sorts of terrible
mistakes together \o/)&lt;/p&gt;
