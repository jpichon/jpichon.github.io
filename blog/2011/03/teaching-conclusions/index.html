</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>My last course to teach Python to beginners ended Monday last week and
wow, am I behind in writing up the post-mortem :)</p>
<p>This time I taught the basics of programming with Python to a group of 6
adults, mostly PhD students either in political sciences or mechanical
engineering. Nearly all of them had used some
statistical/domain-specific language before, such as R or Matlab, which
had a greater impact on the course than I anticipated. I taught in the
students' University and thus was able to donate all the proceeds to
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.python.ie/">Python Ireland</a>, woohoo! To an awesome PyCon
Ireland conference this October!</p>
<div class="section" id="progress-isn-t-linear">
<h2>Progress isn't linear</h2>
<p>The first and most important lesson, for me, was that progress isn't a
linear thing and I really let <a class="reference external" href="https://www.jpichon.net/blog/2011/01/a-few-notes-first-session/">the first
session</a>influence
the pace too much. On the first day, we went through the material in a
blink and I found myself short on exercises and concerned about the
amount of new content that would be required for the rest of the course.</p>
<p>However, this day 1 effect happened because people were already familiar
with the basics of programming, and they had no problem mapping what
they knew to Python. I didn't realise this though, and stepped on the
gas from that point on, failing to adjust properly until several weeks
later. It was brought to my attention later on that actually students
could have used more time and depth to understand several new concepts
(that's where it helps to have a friend as part of your students,
they'll mention it even if in passing!)</p>
<p>Which reminds me: note to self, completely redo the way you introduce
for loops.</p>
<p>Initially, I was also a bit disappointed because I enjoy guiding
students through the ah-ha! moments of figuring out programming and it
felt like people already knew everything. I was wrong here as well,
there may not have been any in the first session but there were plenty
of satisfying ah-ha moments as we went on with the course.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="preparing">
<h2>Preparing</h2>
<p>As usual, I started crashing toward the end of the course ; preparing
and refining material and exercises always takes a ton of personal time
and when the course ended I was much looking forward to having time
again to work on my own projects (...till the next course, as usual! I
never learn ;))</p>
<p>Preparations are really the most time- and mind-consuming aspect of
teaching. Even for the existing material, there's always a bit of work
to try and adapt the exercises to topics that might interest current
students or make lessons flow better. With the pace we were going at, I
didn't have everything ready beforehand either. On the minus side, this
costs time and means the lessons can be less polished. On the plus side,
it usually means the lessons are better suited to the level and
interests of the class.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="student-feedback">
<h2>Student feedback</h2>
<p>This is probably another reason why it took a bit of time to sit down
and write this all up. Overall, on the scale of happiness and knowledge
the students appear satisfied with the course. Some comments on how to
improve the course somewhat confused me. I think once again some felt I
was guiding too much. However this time I'm really happy with how we
learnt to use and navigate the <a class="reference external" href="http://docs.python.org">Python
documentation</a> and I think that's the best
thing I can teach for students to become independent. At that beginner
level, I'm afraid I'm not sure what more to do unless I'm offered
specific suggestions. There was another piece of feedback about still
not being sure where to start if wanting to create a new program.
Something I'd like to experiment with in the future is to start by
giving a big project at the beginning of a course, and then along the
weeks with various exercises we start solving it bit by bit, and
hopefully that would give students a fairer idea on how to break down
problems into manageable tasks. I need to think about it.</p>
<p>Some of the feedback wondered about the point of some of the exercises,
which is very valid criticism. When I create a new lesson and associated
batch of exercises, the ratio of suck tends to be high. It's quite
difficult to find small self-contained exercises, that touch only on the
necessary specific concepts without going all over the place! I need to
hunt for more.</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br /></div>
</div>
<p>Overall I'm happy with how it went and will of course teach again in the
future. I'm disappointed with the way I presented the material at times
though. I think I need to do more public speaking and general talks, to
stop letting myself become intimidated when I speak for a while and no
one's looking my way or interested (or awake!)... as opposed to the
pleasant interactions of helping students debug their programs. Maybe a
lightning talk on teaching programming? ;)</p>
<p>Update: Oh, and I forgot to mention I received homework this time! This
is so cool. It came from students who had a project on the side they
wanted to solve with Python. Hope I helped :)</p>
