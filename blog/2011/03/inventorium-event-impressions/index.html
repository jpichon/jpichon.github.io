</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>As planned I attended the Inventorium event yesterday. Thankfully the
event content and atmosphere matched the flyer's tone, as opposed to the
website's (guess I'm not the audience for that one!)</p>
<p>The evening started with nibbles and sort of cringe worthy &quot;networking&quot;
exercises that felt quite a bit forced but... thanks to it I actually
ended up chatting to someone with a very interesting background, a woman
with a 20 year long career as a software developer who's now training to
become a teacher. I wish we had had more time to chat and I'll be in
touch, I have tons of questions! :-) So yeah, I can sneer all I want,
but it looks like these networky thingies have some value -- for better
or worse!</p>
<p>Overall I had a very good time and found the talks interesting,
sometimes insightful, and other times even inspiring. The evening
started with people introducing the
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.inventorium.org">Inventorium</a> project, etc. Then there
was a wonderful 30 minutes keynote from Jonathan Drori about digital
businesses in general and educational digital businesses in particular.
This was followed by 7 short talks, 10 minutes long, by various people
interested in and involved in education in some way. The speakers
included a teacher and a pupil, which I think brought a very important
perspective (Aron's candid talk generated many smiles!).</p>
<p>Random highlights:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Brendan Tangney, who was the second to last speaker, showed us a
graph that went a bit like this:</li>
</ul>
<pre class="literal-block">
      + 2
     / \    _ _ _ _ + 4
    /   \ /
   /     + 3
1 +
</pre>
<p>with names such as 1. &quot;New technology trigger&quot;, 2. &quot;Peak of inflated
expectations, 3. &quot;Trough of disillusionment&quot; and 4. &quot;Plateau of
productivity&quot;, x axis as time. When he asked the audience what stage we
thought ICT in education was at, answers varied between 1, 2 and 3.
Turns out everyone was right, kinda: we have an interesting issue in ICT
in education, in that we keep looping from 1 to 3, and then instead of
trying to figure out how to go through the &quot;slope of enlightenment&quot;
(between 3 and 4) we just go back to 1 with the latest technological
novelty. Considering how many people mentioned the iPad and its
potential for this or that, I thought that point really hit home!</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>I knew about <a class="reference external" href="http://www.camara.ie">Camara</a>'s work in Africa, but
I didn't know they were also getting involved in <a class="reference external" href="http://www.camaraireland.ie">education in
Ireland</a>, providing refurbishing PCs
to disadvantaged schools and teaching training! This is great!</li>
<li>Stephen Carey, the teacher, talked to us about the Suas &quot;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.suas.ie/b2c.html">Bridge 2
College</a>&quot; program and the gap it
attempts to fill. To illustrate his main point, that collaboration
between students is the best way to learn, he showed us this
wonderful picture of how they've rethought the classroom layout for
the program. I wish I could find the exact same picture but this one
gives an idea already -- it's impossible to simply stand at the front
and blandly lecture.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="Classroom pictures, the class is divided in smaller walled sections" src="https://www.jpichon.net/site_media/images/2011/inventorium-suas.png" /></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Martin Owen showed us the toy for pre-schoolers his company is
developing... and I want some of these tiles for myself, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.smaltitech.com">check out
the videos</a>!!</li>
</ul>
<p>Very happy with my evening. I will be watching out for upcoming
Inventorium events and the project's outputs.</p>
