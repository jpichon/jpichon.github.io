meet-up</a>
last Wednesday -- another great event, after which I promptly fell sick
(getting ready to kick ass again now though :)). In January, the group
had a simple and nice &quot;pub meet-up&quot;, where a few Python beginners and
novices turned up (including one who's now my student *waves*), and it
was thus decided it would be good to have some introductory talks in the
following months. Hence February's first talk:</p>
<div class="section" id="introduction-to-python">
<h2>Introduction to Python</h2>
<p>In this talk, Sean gave a quick introduction to Python by comparing it
with other programming languages ; namely C, Java and Ruby.</p>
<p>I must say I took notes in preparation for my crash course later on :o)
Nice ideas on how to present a new language to programmers. The
comparison wasn't only on the syntax or verbosity, and general
programming paradigms espoused by the languages but also on the
different cultures encouraged by their respective community. Very
interesting! Though unfortunately, probably difficult to follow for
beginners new to programming, of which there was at least 1 in the room
-- but it's difficult (impossible) to create a talk that caters to
everyone in the whole world.</p>
<p>Somehow post-talk questions mostly resolved around high performance
parallel programming :)</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="advanced-unit-testing">
<h2>Advanced unit testing</h2>
<p>Rory enthusiastically introduced us to the latest additions in the unit
test framework for Python 2.7 (backported from 3.x into unittest2), and
after this talk I can't wait to enthusiastically switch my programs to
Python 2.7. Exciting stuff. For instance...</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>more Asserts! With cool names, like assertAlmostEquals ;)
assertMultiLineEquals sounds fairly cool too, it gives you a diff as
opposed to the whole strings that didn't match.</li>
<li>when you have a slow setUp() or you simply do reads without writes...
I introduce setUpClass()! Yes! There's even a setUpModule if all the
tests for your module share a setup step. Of course the same exist
for tearDown().</li>
<li>&quot;discover&quot; will find and run your tests without you having to add the
__main__ stanza to all your test files, yay. It works like this:</li>
</ul>
<pre class="literal-block">
python -m unittest discover -s [path]
</pre>
<p>You can specify a class or function if you like.</p>
<p>The rest of the talk was about mocks. Mocks. Mocks. They're not in the
main unit test framework and voidspace's seems to be the recommended
library. It was interesting to see how they're used. Mock patch enables
doing all the mocking stuff with fancy decorators, thus avoiding you the
pain of manually storing and restoring the original value of something
before you replace it with a mock. Overall veeery interesting.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="agm-pub">
<h2>AGM &amp; Pub</h2>
<p>A short and sweet AGM followed where the committee ended up re-elected
(go committee, y'all rock!). We then moved on to the pub where general
Python and other techie discussions happily prevailed for the rest of
the evening.</p>
