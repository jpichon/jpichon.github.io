</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>I got &quot;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Survive-Your-First-Year-Teaching/dp/184706471X">How to survive your first year in
teaching</a>&quot;
after finding some very positive reviews and it's been worth every cent
-- from the beginning I had to stop reading to take notes and add
bookmarks for future reference. The target is &quot;real&quot; teachers (at the
primary and secondary level) who are preparing for the first year of
teaching on their own after their training.</p>
<p>At my level (volunteer unqualified teacher), I found the book tips very
good to help structure both a course and specific lessons. There are
many activity ideas to try out in class and suggestions to avoid
sticking only to one teaching style (e.g. lecturing) -- it doesn't
matter what age group you're teaching, there will be something useful
and I've already been applying some of them. I'll be re-reading the
behaviour and class management chapters when I teach high school
students again (having a clue what to do will hopefully help in these
situations!)</p>
<p>For non-professional teachers like me, there are a number of chapters
that don't apply, like class decoration or school administrative tasks.
I still found them interesting on my first read-through though I'll
likely skip them on subsequent reads (and I learnt a bit about the UK
school system... for instance I thought &quot;houses&quot; only existed in the
Harry Potter world :-)).</p>
<p>The kind of sections I bookmarked: activities to try in class, balanced
lesson planning, setting aims and objectives, differentiation, resources
to spice up lessons, assessing and marking (great to understand the
types of feedback you can offer), grading and writing reports (feedback
to students once again). I was pleased to read the section on
differentiation and find that I had figured out a lot of it on my own,
though I could definitely improve on differentiating for weaker
students. Might need some additional resources on the topic. Anyone has
recommendations to offer?</p>
