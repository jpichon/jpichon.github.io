</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>Last week-end I attended the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.educatetogether.ie/press-releases/2010/12/upcoming-conference-re-imagining-learning/">Re-imagining
Learning</a>
conference in Limerick, a conference by the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.educatetogether.ie/">Educate
Together</a> folks aiming to rethink
early secondary school.</p>
<p>As expected the majority of the talks were very interesting and/or
inspiring. The way the schedule seemed to work, keynotes were meant to
be higher level and make the audience think and ponder and imagine,
while the sessions in between were more practical, sharing information
on past or current initiatives by education professionals.</p>
<p>Attending a conference outside of my field was an interesting
experience, although I found it awkward to introduce myself. I thought
afterwards I should have simply left it to &quot;I'm interested&quot; rather than
trying to justify my presence, but thinking again I'm not quite sure it
really explains what the hell I'm doing here. Ah well. I can figure it
out as I participate in more of these events, I guess.</p>
<p>I took a ton of notes, however as I haven't been good in the past at
transcribing talks, I'll start by posting a mishmash of thoughts, themes
and ideas that I took home with me.</p>
<p>First and foremost, there is a lot happening in Ireland in education at
the moment, including curriculum reform (recommendations) at the Junior
level. It was inspiring to be surrounded by professionals in the field
who obviously care so deeply about what is going on and how to improve
the state of things.</p>
<p>The Friday morning keynotes looked at the early years of the Junior
level, covering how these first few years have a major impact that will
affect the attitude of the student toward school until the end of their
schooling. &quot;<strong>Curriculum integration</strong>&quot; was a big theme over the two
days and another speaker noted curriculum cannot be looked at
independently, it is heavily dependent on the political context even if
we like to pretend it is neutral.</p>
<p>John Portelli's keynote was very interesting, explaining the importance
of a critical-<strong>democratic</strong> framework and the dangers of pre-judging.
He touched on a lot of themes and it was incredibly frustrating to see
him having to rush through the ideas he was introducing. Although the
conference was very professionally organised, time-keeping was terrible
from the beginning and it put a lot of undue pressure on speakers who
felt they had to fly through their material.</p>
<p>Some <strong>practical tips</strong> I picked up during some of the sessions:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>In Sean O'Leary's talk on <strong>science differentiation</strong>, he mentioned
simple ways to make material more accessible, for instance <strong>language
level readability</strong>. He showed examples of a science exercise, and
how to rewrite it so that it means the exact same thing, the problem
is framed the same, however the language is simpler which removes a
potential barrier. That's something I absolutely want to look into,
because I know I am guilty of it, as I tend to switch to smartass
academic language whenever I write an exercise sheet that I know I
will be handing out. He also uses <strong>visual cues</strong> as often as
possible to help with memory (rebus). To dos:<ul>
<li>Find a site or software to assess the readability level of the
material I write.</li>
<li>Check out the <a class="reference external" href="http://sess.ie/resources/science-differentiation-action">Science Differentiation
Pack</a>
the speaker worked on and see what I can use in there</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Neil Bulter showed us all sorts of games he used in class to
encourage students to develop their problem solving skills. See
notably <a class="reference external" href="http://fantasticcontraption.com">Fantastic Contraptions</a>,
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.wickedpissahgames.com/games/gravitypods/GravityPods.html">Gravity
Pods</a>,
and <a class="reference external" href="http://armorgames.com/play/2205/light-bot">Light bot.</a> To
dos:<ul>
<li>This last one I must check out properly and see if it can help
newcomers come to term with how programming works</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Some <strong>general ideas</strong> that stick to mind:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Like everyone teenagers want to know more about themselves,
understand who they are and what is their place in the world. By
teaching them about development theories they can learn to make
better decisions. Development theories include multiple
intelligences, etc.</li>
<li>Teaching in groups is excellent and the ideal way to do things,
however the teacher needs to help/teach/promote higher level thinking
and discussions, to move it beyond disputes (e.g. partner phrases)</li>
<li>I didn't know the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.ics.ie/">Irish Computer Society</a> was
so involved with school and education! They train schools in using
technology to engage with students. And they even have an awesome
Scratch handbook! To dos:<ul>
<li>Get the handbook</li>
<li>Find out more!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Many times speakers put forward the idea of having the teacher stand
back and act more as a <strong>facilitator</strong> and <strong>guide</strong>. For instance,
community-based learning (Martin Galvin), that encourages young
people to look into a problem in their community (e.g. nutrition
based health problems) and learn about it in a self-driven way and
through community service. Giving an ill-structured problem (a very
general question) that has no clear-cut answer, and let students run
with it! See also the Global Learning Initiative Project (Lori
Holcom) that hooks up students with other students from schools
around the world.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some <strong>books/articles</strong> I want to look into:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The Passionate Teacher, 1995</li>
<li>Something to learn more about teacher follow-up moves, by Brodie
(2008). This was mentioned as part of the talk on &quot;fostering a
'conjecturing atmosphere' in mathematics lessons&quot; (Therese Dooley).</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course the conference covered all these topics (and more!) in much
more details and I have a lot of things to think about, think through
and hopefully use to better my own beginner-teaching and make it more
relevant.</p>
<p>Additionally, I met with Paddy, a retired school principal from Cork,
who was kind enough to give me some advice on how to find a school near
where I live and who to talk with to see about teaching programming to
high school students. A big to-do!</p>
