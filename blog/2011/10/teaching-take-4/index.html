</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>As <a class="reference external" href="https://www.jpichon.net/blog/2011/09/teaching-again/">mentioned
before</a>, I'm
teaching programming again, to a group of beginners :) (Although as
usual, even in a group of complete beginners there are variations in
people's levels and comfort with the subject.)</p>
<div class="section" id="initial-advertising">
<h2>Initial advertising</h2>
<p>I'm really happy with how the PR worked out this time. The first time I
taught this course in <a class="reference external" href="http://www.tog.ie">Tog</a>, I made the mistake of
putting &quot;Python&quot; in the name of the course and ended up <a class="reference external" href="https://www.jpichon.net/blog/2010/09/intro-to-programming-session-3/">wasting a lot
of time screening out
people</a>
who wouldn't be a good fit. This time I only <a class="reference external" href="http://www.tog.ie/2011/09/introduction-to-programming/">mentioned it in
passing</a>, and
the amount and type of answers I got was much more manageable and
appropriate. We still managed to fill up the course and to have a
waiting list (hope to see you next time!), so it's a success. I'm
pasting the announcement here for future reference:</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Class: Introduction to Programming</div>
<div class="line">Are you curious about programming? Ever wished you could write your
own scripts to automate repetitive tasks, or for fun? Or been
interested in understanding how an application works (and why there
are always bugs in the software you use??). Tog is running a new class
on learning how to program, for complete beginners with no previous
programming knowledge.</div>
<div class="line">The course will cover basic programming skills, which will also give
you a better understanding of how computers work. We will be using
Python, an excellent learning language because it is simple yet
powerful, and extremely readable. At the end of the course you will
know how to write simple programs, and you should have enough
understanding of the basics to move on to either more complex
programming tasks in Python or learn another language if you wish to.</div>
<div class="line">The course will begin on October 20th and will run for 5 weeks every
Thursday from 7.00pm to 9.30pm. The cost is €40 for non-members, and
free for members. The class size is limited to about 8 people, for a
relaxed atmosphere conducive to learning.</div>
<div class="line">If you are interested in attending, or have any question about the
course, please use the form below or leave a comment — we’re happy to
answer any query! You must sign up if you want to attend, space is
limited.</div>
<div class="line">Please note that this is a course for complete beginners, who are not
yet familiar with the usual syntax for programming. If you’re a
programmer interested in picking up Python, you should keep an eye out
for our crash courses!</div>
</div>
<p>A fair percentage of the students heard about the course from Twitter
even though I'm not on it, which is interesting. I should explore how to
use the tool better. As I mostly hang out with fellow nerds, reaching
out to interested beginners is always tough, so anything that can
help...</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="pace">
<h2>Pace</h2>
<p>The pace of the course is manageable as well -- which doesn't mean
preparing and teaching isn't time-consuming still! But I felt quite
burnt out last time after the pace at which I taught the PhD students
(mostly through <a class="reference external" href="https://www.jpichon.net/blog/2011/03/teaching-conclusions/">my own
fault</a>), so
it's refreshing to come back to teaching pure beginners and not go crazy
from week 2.</p>
<p>Surprisingly enough and to my utter delight, a huge portion of the
students took on the exercises as homework! I'm so happy when I get
questions about the exercises or lessons via email, to see people
interested enough to poke at problems outside of the classroom. If we
keep it up we should be able to cover more as well, which will be
interesting for everyone.</p>
<p>As for feedback, I found a
<a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/#%21/BurlyQEinstein/status/127413143025627136">couple</a>
of positive
<a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/#%21/ickle_tayto/status/127343537309220864">tweets</a>
after the first session, which is always encouraging. Woohoo \o/</p>
