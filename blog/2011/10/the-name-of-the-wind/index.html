recently. Very enjoyable, including the book reviews, particularly when
I read Michelle West's
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.sfsite.com/fsf/2011/msw1109.htm">review</a> of the sequel to
the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/Name-Wind-Kingkiller-Chonicle-ebook/dp/B003HV0TN2/">Name of the
Wind</a>
(no spoilers for either book here):</p>
<div class="quote"><p>PATRICK Rothfuss's first novel, <em>The Name of the Wind,</em> was possibly my
favorite novel of the last decade. It brought me back to a time when
books were the best way to travel to distant places. It burned away the
ennui that had troubled my reading for longer than I care to remember.
<em>The Wise Man's Fear</em> is the sequel, the second book in the Kingkiller
Chronicles. It is not short. It is a worthy follow-up?</p>
<p>Yes. Very much yes.</p>
<p>But if I'm being honest, that was never a concern.</p>
<p>Books are a little like people to me. There are some that impress me
with the clean, clear edges of their thought; there are some that I find
both fascinating and repelling; there are some that I grow to love over
the passage of pages; there are some that try too hard to impress. I
name no names here because books are also personal, and my
categorizations will not map onto anyone else's with any degree of
accuracy.</p>
<p>There are some books that I'm drawn to instantly; there is something
about them that feels real, true, and compelling for reasons that are
not immediately clear to me. Often those reasons take form and shape
only after I close the covers and sort out thoughts. I don't doubt these
books when I pick them up; I don't doubt them when I open them. I don't
second-guess them; I'm willing—even grateful—to take what's offered,
suspending judgment but offering wonder, awe, outrage, and respect in
turn.</p>
<p>Rothfuss writes such books. <em>Wise Man's Fear</em> is the longest book I'll
read this year, and I didn't want to leave it. If Neal Stephenson wrote
fantasy, the resulting books would have some of this texture and weight.</p>
<p>Picking up the threads of Kvothe's story from <em>The Name of the Wind</em>,
[...]</p>
</div><p>The rest of the review does contain spoilers, I assume -- I stopped
right there and went to buy the Name of the Wind, which proved to be
quite a wonderful and addictive read indeed. Warmly recommended! The
writing style is quite original and the story and world grip you in
straight from the beginning.</p>
<p>I'm holding on -- with great difficulty -- getting the sequel, to try to
space the books out while waiting for the final volume of the trilogy to
be out. We'll see how long that lasts...</p>
