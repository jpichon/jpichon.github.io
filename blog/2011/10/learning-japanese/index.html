</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>Since listening to the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.jpichon.net/blog/2011/09/michel-thomas-method/">Michel Thomas Foundation
Course</a>,
I've been intensifying my learning of Japanese. I'm not sure if I'm
learning in a sustainable way, but I'm enjoying the journey and will
ride the wave of motivation while it lasts :) In case I inadvertently
take a break and later want to come back to it, I'm going to write down
a few words on what I'm doing at the moment. Perhaps it'll be useful to
someone else too.</p>
<div class="section" id="audio">
<h2>Audio</h2>
<p>I just finished the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Michel-Thomas-Method-Japanese-Advanced/dp/0340974591/">**Michel Thomas** Advanced
Course</a>,
listening to one lesson in the bus every morning for the last while.
When I initially picked up the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.jpichon.net/blog/2011/09/michel-thomas-method/">Foundation
Course</a>, I
was hoping to learn some conversational Japanese without worrying about
the writing system ; however I really enjoyed the Advanced Course, which
taught me lots of things I either never learnt or more likely completely
forgot about since my initial stint at Japanese 10 years ago.</p>
<p>The Michel Thomas Method is wonderful to build confidence, and the
Advanced course introduces you to many interesting grammar structures
using the -て and -た forms. I'm looking at <a class="reference external" href="http://www.japanesepod101.com/">Japanese Pod
101</a> to get my audio fix now --
their content seems very good, despite the spammy feel of their sign-up
process. They actually offer a lot more than audio.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="grammar">
<h2>Grammar</h2>
<p>To get back to writing, a text book seemed appropriate to start learning
&quot;proper.&quot; I'm using the kana version of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/Japanese-Busy-People-Kana-Version/dp/4770030096/">**Japanese for Busy
People**</a>,
mainly because I was eager to begin learning and it was available at my
local bookshop, and the Amazon reviews are good. Don't use the romaji
version. I'm enjoying it, there are plenty of exercises and they try to
use pictures as often as possible to help with retention, there's a CD
included with the book and some of exercises are audio (listen then
answer the questions in the book). It doesn't expand on grammar rules a
lot though, so one should make sure to go back to the grammar pages
regularly. For those not in a rush and with the money to spare, the
<strong>Genki</strong> series <a class="reference external" href="http://www.tofugu.com/japanese-resources/genki/">looks to be fairly
good</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="kanji-vocabulary">
<h2>Kanji &amp; Vocabulary</h2>
<p>One of the things I'm determined not to be discouraged by this time is
kanji. I got myself the very <a class="reference external" href="http://www.whiterabbitpress.com/catalog/Japanese-Kanji-Flashcards-Series-2-Volume-1-p-16165.html">nice and sturdy **White Rabbit flash
cards**</a>...</p>
<p>...Unfortunately after 40 or 50 kanji the ideograms, readings and
meanings stopped sticking into my head. It was time for context. See
below! The cards are still good to have around for recall, just not as a
single learning source.</p>
<p>For vocabulary, I'm also testing <a class="reference external" href="http://iknow.jp/">**Iknow.jp**</a>,
for which I luckily obtained a 4 month free subscription. It doesn't
focus on kanji as much as I'd like, but you learn to recognise words and
sentences with both audio and text, which is quite good. They have
several courses that together teach thousands of words of vocabulary.</p>
<p>In general, to guide my learning of kanji I'm using the kanji list
recommendations for the <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jlpt">Japanese Proficiency Level
Test</a>. Weakest level is N5 and
requires about 100 kanjis (reading a newspaper requires about 2000!).
I'm also curious at the <strong>TextFugu</strong> approach of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.textfugu.com/free-lessons/">teaching the radicals
first</a>, which seems to make
more sense to me and is another avenue to explore.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="kanji-in-context">
<h2>Kanji in context</h2>
<p>I tried a bilingual manga, which was a mistake (the English sticks out
more prominently than the Japanese, and probably doesn't encourage
focusing as hard on recognising kanjis). What I will warmly recommend
are the wonderful <a class="reference external" href="http://www.whiterabbitpress.com/product.php?productid=16972&amp;cat=0&amp;page=1">**Japanese Graded Level Reader** book
series</a>.
I'm going through Volume 0 at the moment (300 words/story, about 300
words of vocabulary overall) which read like simple children stories and
I find them as confidence building for reading as the Michel Thomas
method was for listening. Each volume contains 6 booklets entirely in
Japanese, in which new concepts and words are repeated a lot so that
between the repetition and the pictures, the reader can figure out the
meaning of most of the story. It's very cute, and you learn about
Japanese culture as well. Very much recommended. There are many volumes
for different levels.</p>
<p>After I read one of the aforementioned &quot;Reader&quot; booklets, I add the
kanji and grammar expressions I don't yet know to a set of
<a class="reference external" href="http://ankisrs.net/">**Anki**</a> flashcards, with the help of
<a class="reference external" href="http://jisho.org/">jisho.org</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.guidetojapanese.org/learn/grammar">Tae Kim's guide to Japanese
grammar</a> if needed.
Anki's a wonderful piece of software! You can synchronise for free
between different machines to make sure the Spaced Repetition algorithm
keeps up no matter where you go through the cards, and it has a Maemo
port (ankiqt900), among many other platforms. I'm still figuring out how
best to make cards ; sometimes having the kanji on its own, other times
including context.</p>
<p>Finally, I bought the first volume of a manga I'm interested in that has
furigana, and I'm still exploring what's the best way to read, and
learn, and create flash cards out of it without ruining the flow, losing
interest or having to make 20 flashcards out of every bubble... (ahem!)
I don't expect the process to be fast in any case :)</p>
<p>勉強しましょう。(&lt;- let's begin testing the unicode resilience of this
lil' blog!)</p>
