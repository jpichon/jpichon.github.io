</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>The <a class="reference external" href="http://desktopsummit.org">Desktop Summit</a> is finished for me,
though it continues on with workshop and BoFs.</p>
<p>Berlin's weather is pretty much like Dublin's with regard to the sky
colour and rain status; though maybe with a few more degrees :) I quite
enjoyed the conference, very happy to meet again the friends I made last
year as well as meeting up with new interesting people (btw, if you
asked about my card, it was made at <a class="reference external" href="http://www.moo.com">moo.com</a>:
get yours now!!). It was also great to meet a couple of cool people
whose activities I follow online, though I'd like to find a way to
introduce myself to someone I know who doesn't know me in a perhaps less
creepy way :o) (Sorry people, it was still a pleasure!)</p>
<p>I found less elation in the technical talks this year than last, perhaps
because it's difficult to beat the excitement of seeing Gnome 3 work for
the first time, pre-release. The ones I attended were still interesting
and hinted at all the solid work that is going on currently, and I
really enjoyed the many discussions on outreach, collaboration between
the projects and within projects, and all that goodness. The <a class="reference external" href="https://www.desktopsummit.org/program/sessions/gnome-state-union">Gnome
State of the
Union</a>
talk was a hoot, and one of the highlights for me was when they showed a
list of quotes from unhappy users, like &quot;if they treat their users like
idiots, they should expect idiots as users&quot; (or something like this),
etc., as we're seeing online at the moment. It turned out these quotes
were about the Gnome <strong>2.0</strong> release, and this makes me hopeful once the
dust settles down, people will look at Gnome 3 with less of a knee-jerk
reaction (and might still decide it's not for them, of course).</p>
<p>I will try to put together my notes into a few posts, though I can
guarantee I won't have the time to be as thorough (or long-winded,
depending on the point of view!) as in <a class="reference external" href="https://www.jpichon.net/tag/europython/">my notes for
EuroPython</a> unless I get the
flu or something.</p>
<p>Many thanks to the organisers for putting together the conference and
parties, I had a great time -- s'y'all next year!</p>
