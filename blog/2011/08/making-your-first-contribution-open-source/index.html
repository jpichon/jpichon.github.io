<p>I gave my presentation on &quot;making your first open-source contribution&quot;
in <a class="reference external" href="http://www.tog.ie">Tog</a> yesterday evening and I think it went
down well; I enjoyed delivering the talk and received positive comments
about it afterwards -- although I do need to speak louder. I'm enjoying
lightning talks! Now, what to speak about next... :)</p>
<p>The slides are available on
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.slideshare.net/jpichon/making-your-first-opensource-contribution">Slideshare</a>
(or
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.jpichon.net/site_media/presentations/2011_08_25_ContributingOSS_TOG.pdf">PDF</a>).
I also gave a
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.jpichon.net/site_media/presentations/2011_08_25_ContributingOSS_TOG_handout.pdf">hand-out</a>
to give people a chance to check out the links afterwards.</p>

<p>On another note I think an evening of lightning talks was generally well
received, and there is some motivation to run another similar event in 2
months. I'd love to have this be a regular thing. We need to be more
strict on time-keeping though; surprisingly it seems people tend to feel
bad for not speaking long enough, so they start just talking about
random stuff or opening web links of cool things to show off... and
interesting or not it feels like it's dragging on, particularly when one
knows there's 3 or 4 more talks to go after.</p>
<p>I also got feedback from first time visitors that starting late &quot;because
people will be late anyway&quot; makes it very sucky for people who don't
know anyone yet, and also less likely that there'll be time to stick
around after the talks to chat with the speakers and other attendees. I
think we should start right on time next time (and to be fair, the 2 or
3 people who arrived between 7:00pm (announced time) and 7:30pm (actual
starting time) were members... Not worth waiting for!!). It'd be nice to
start on time and then encourage people to stay with drinks and cookies,
or otherwise we need to find a social butterfly that is good at
integrating people. :-)</p>
<p>Writing this down now, so that I can remember it in 2 months. Any other
comments on the evening from people who were there, or general
suggestions and tips on organising lightning talks?</p>
