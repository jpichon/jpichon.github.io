</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>I'm preparing my next course at the moment. Another introduction to
Python for beginners, but in a different context: this is for a group of
political sciences students, who use R for statistical simulations and
are encouraged to look up Python for the next level of that module.</p>
<p>...Well I hope to be teaching them, we're having a bit of a hiccup
securing a room at the moment! In any case, I'm reshuffling my material
to use the feedback received last time as well as insights from a couple
of education articles and books I've been looking at. It's a different
angle from what I've done before: although they need to learn
programming basics they'll also clearly want to be able to solve some
specific problems on their own afterwards. I hope to find a way to
satisfy this. One of the great issues I'm encountering when teaching is
how difficult it is for students to decompose a problem into smaller
manageable steps; I hope to include some level of doing this from the
very beginning... We'll see how it works.</p>
<p>What would I like to do next, after that?</p>
<div class="section" id="crash-courses">
<h2>Crash courses</h2>
<p>I mentioned them last year and people loved the idea, but end of years
being what they are it didn't happen then. Someone pinged me about it
again this month though, and it generated so much interest before that
I'm really keen on preparing that one. Once I have the format worked
out, it should be very easy to repeat it many times (and considering the
number of people that expressed an interest in the past that definitely
wouldn't hurt!) because it won't be a time-consuming one -- an afternoon
-- which is quite exciting.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="teaching-young-people">
<h2>Teaching young people</h2>
<p>This is what I &quot;meant to do next&quot; after my last course already :/ Adult
courses are so much easier to organise: someone expresses an interest, I
get excited to see someone interested, we plot when to set it up and
it's obvious it'll be in the evening because I have a job and they have
a job, other people join -&gt; <em>learning</em>!</p>
<p>When I was talking to schools on the other hand, the schedule where they
could fit me clashed thoroughly with work (between the time to teach and
the time to get there and back), and sometimes they also suggested I
teach as part of the mandatory computer class, which is not something
I'm quite ready for (teaching a full class of uninterested teenagers...
nope!). I was also very excited when I visited the <a class="reference external" href="http://theclubhouse.ie/">Computer
Clubhouse</a> and talked with the people there,
but unfortunately I have to admit I work too far and presently it would
be too stressful to try to make it there on time to do something
interesting before they close.</p>
<p>I'll have to think hard about this and figure something out (post-first
crash course runs, though!). Summer camps could also be an option.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="teaching-girls">
<h2>Teaching girls</h2>
<p>This is an idea I've been toying with for a while and once I figure out
the scheduling bit I want to give it a shot as well. I'm

<a class="reference external" href="http://compscigail.blogspot.com/2008/10/ghc-artemis-project-teaching-computer.html">suggest</a>
knowing one will &quot;not be the only girl&quot; helps removing the intimidation
factor and get interested girls to join a computing or programming
class.</p>
<p>(Doesn't mean I'd stop teaching mixed classes, I still can't resist the
appeal of someone interested wanting to learn :))</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="teaching-students">
<h2>Teaching students</h2>
<p>That's something I <a class="reference external" href="https://www.jpichon.net/blog/2010/08/python-ireland-august-meetup/">mentioned
briefly</a>
here before, the idea of teaching an introduction to programming using
Python to college CS students before their course begins, particularly
targeting minorities to level up the playing field (and here's a <a class="reference external" href="http://geekfeminism.org/2010/08/10/restore-meritocracy-in-cs-with-an-obscure-functional-programming-language/">blog
post on the
topic</a>
I linked to before). I've also been flipping through '<a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/Unlocking-Clubhouse-Computing-Jane-Margolis/dp/0262133989">Unlocking the
clubhouse</a>'
lately for references and I'm disheartened to link some of what I read
to women I know who were initially interested in CS but dropped out just
recently.</p>
<p>Initially when I started wanting to teach young people, my hope was to
be an evident living proof for all genders that of course there are
women who are enthusiastic about programming, and hopefully encourage a
few girls to consider it as a career choice. I feel a bit like I've
fallen short of my goal, though it's possible I'm just being too
impatient :)</p>
