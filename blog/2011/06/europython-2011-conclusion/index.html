</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>Taking a break from writing up my notes into blog posts to share a few
general thoughts about the conference.</p>
<p>General feeling: Woohooooo! This was a <strong>fantastic</strong> week, I learnt a
ton and met an amazing amount of awesome people. If you're here because
I gave you one of my cards, hi! o/ It was lovely to meet you. (If you
asked about the card and forgot, these are <strong>MooCards</strong> from
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.moo.com">moo.com</a>. Get yourself some! People <em>fought</em>
over these at EuroPython, I'll have you know. They're that good!)</p>
<p>The conference was wonderfully well organised, including the evening
events. I fondly recommend the <strong>bistecca alla Florentina</strong> <a class="reference external" href="http://ep2011.europython.eu/blog/2011/05/18/pyfiorentina-legendary-steak">from
Zaza</a>!
Everyone was incredibly <strong>friendly</strong>, like at <a class="reference external" href="https://www.jpichon.net/blog/2010/07/pycon-ireland-2010/">PyCon
Ireland</a> last
year it was common to strike up interesting conversations with a random
stranger besides you and impromptu dinner plans would be shared between
groups.</p>
<p>I was humbled by how <strong>egoless</strong> most people I spoke with were. They
seem to know that no one knows absolutely everything about Python (and
there were funny anecdotes about this, such as famous names requesting
new features that are already in the language!). I was incredibly
surprised when one of the keynote speakers sat at my table during lunch
on the first day -- I had assumed well-know people would have solid
cliques and no time or desire to meet new faces. And of course they
ended up being just as nice as everyone else.</p>
<p>Some things I grumbled over: the constant <strong>strikes</strong> in Italy, first at
the airport when I landed then the trains when I (tried to) leave! I was
disappointed to miss out on the training I was hoping to attend as well,
the rooms were a bit small and filled up long before the training
starting time. Lesson learnt for next year!</p>
<p>...And indeed I am much looking forward to going again next year. In the
meantime I welcome all Pythonistas to <strong>`PyCon
Ireland &lt;http://python.ie/pyconireland/&gt;`__ in Dublin this October</strong>! :D</p>
