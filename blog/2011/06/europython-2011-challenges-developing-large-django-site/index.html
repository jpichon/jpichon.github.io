<h2>Tips and tricks</h2>
<div class="section" id="signing-from-1-4-currently-in-trunk">
<h3>Signing (from 1.4, currently in trunk)</h3>
<p>Using cryptographic signing for various things can ensure that they
haven't been tampered with, for instance a cookie or an unsubscribe
link. If you encrypt your session cookies you don't have to hit the
database anymore, you just need to check the proper signed cookie.</p>
<p>The speaker showed a couple of short code examples to demonstrate how
simple it is to use, and how the interface is consistent with the other
serialisation interfaces.</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
from django.core import signing
signing.dumps({&quot;foo&quot;: &quot;bar&quot;})&nbsp; # url safe
signing.loads(string)
</pre>
</div>
<div class="section" id="cache-version">
<h3>cache_version</h3>
<p>This is another way to do cache invalidation. You add a cache_version
field to the model, that is incremented when calling the save() hook or
a touch() method. In the template cache fragment, you use the primary
key and the cache_version to invalidate.</p>
<p>You can also mass invalidate by updating the cache version of
objects.all() using F() -- example from the slides:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
topic.conferences.all().update(
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cache_version = F('cache_version') + 1
)
</pre>
</div>
<div class="section" id="nosql-for-denormalisation">
<h3>noSQL for denormalisation</h3>
<p>Use noSQL to denormalise and keep the database and the cache/nosql in
sync. It's more work but it's worth it.</p>
<p>For instance they use Redis sets to maintain lists such as
username-follows, europython-attendees and then they simply need to do a
set intersection to get the information they want. These are only lists
of ids so they don't take that much space.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="hashed-static-asset-filenames-in-cloudfront">
<h3>Hashed static asset filenames in CloudFront</h3>
<p>They created a management command to push static assets, that compresses
Javascript, changes the names/urls, etc. This way they can publish them
in advance, and also keep static files around if there's a need to
rollback. The different names are also good to prevent Internet Explorer
caching.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="challenges">
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<p>This part of the talk is about things they don't really have answers
for.</p>
<div class="section" id="http-requests">
<h3>HTTP Requests</h3>
<p>e.g. talking to an API: what if it fails or take 30 seconds? Do you use
urllib? What if people enter private urls from within your Intranet? :O</p>
<p>You have to handle connection timeouts, logging and profiling, url
validation, and http caching. All of these are a common set of problems
that should be baked into the framework.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="profiling-and-debugging-production-problems">
<h3>Profiling and debugging production problems</h3>
<p>Debugging in development rocks, with the django-debug-toolbar, the way
error 500 are handled, pdb, etc.</p>
<p>Once you turn debug to False, you're blind. After a while, all the bugs,
particularly performance bugs, only happen in production.</p>
<p>He showed us a code snippet for a UserBasedExceptionMiddleware, that if
you access the page throwing a 500 error and is_superuser is True, you
will see a traceback, not the default 500 error (so if one of your users
reports a problem, you can go to the page straight off and see a
traceback).</p>
<p>At the database level, there is a handy tool called <strong>mysql-proxy</strong> that
is customisable using Lua. Using a wonderful, horribly documented
library called log.lua, you can for instance turn on logging for a
couple of minutes when needed.</p>
<p>He created an app called django_instrumented (unreleased, until it's
cleaned up) that collects statistics and sticks them into memcached. He
has a special bookmark to access them, they are stored for 5 minutes
only&nbsp; -- so they waste neither space or time.</p>
<p>This actually helped improve the performance: if you measure something
and make it visible, people will improve it over time.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="downtime-deployments">
<h3>0 downtime deployments</h3>
<p>Code-wise it's easy enough to do, but when there are database changes
it's tougher. Ideally they try to make schema changes backwards
compatible, then use ./manage.py migrate (using South) on another web
server.</p>
<p>Having a read-only mode made a lot of problems easier! It's not 0
downtime but the content is still readable. It can be a setting or a
Redis key.</p>
<p>Feature flags work in the same way but at a more fine-grained level, for
instance turning off search while you update your solr cluster. There's
quite a bit more work involved.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="one-lesson-we-keep-on-learning-in-django">
<h2>One lesson we keep on learning in Django</h2>
<p>We went from one database to multi-databases, from one cache to
multi-caches, from one haystack backend to multiple backends.</p>
<p>Debug is one single setting, that affects a lot of things.</p>
<p>The timezone setting also affects Apache log files.</p>
<p>The middleware concept is very powerful, but is executed on every single
request: if there's a conditional it has to be done within the
middleware.</p>
<p>Really, global settings should be flushed out of the project! They are
evil settings that cannot be changed at runtime.</p>
