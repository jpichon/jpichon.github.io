</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>I've been using the <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michel_thomas">Michel
Thomas</a> Method to learn
Japanese lately, using <a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Michel-Thomas-Method-Japanese-Foundation/dp/0340974575/">this set of
CDs</a>
(8 hours). It works wonderfully well. The method only claims to teach
you basic conversation skills, no writing or reading, and does so
without requiring you to learn long lists of vocabulary or really, do
anything outside of listening to the lessons. Each CD is cut into short
lessons lasting between 3 and 8 minutes, and all you need to do is
listen carefully and make use of the pause button to think of your
answer before hearing the correct way to say something. There're 2 other
students on the recordings, sometimes making mistakes and asking
questions. You play the role of the 3rd student.</p>
<p>Through non-boring repetition, you learn how to structure different
types of sentences and slowly add new words to your vocabulary. It's
very enjoyable and you get a great sense of accomplishment when you
remember things and figure out how to express something new. I usually
listen on the bus -- I found listening while walking didn't work as well
because a pedestrian needs to pay a lot of attention to their
surroundings in the city if they'd like to not die, so I wasn't focused
enough and ended up forgetting more.</p>
<p>The leaflet that comes with the box is adamant that <strong>your learning is
the teacher's responsibility</strong>. You shouldn't try to learn stuff off by
heart, or force yourself to remember or pick up new things in your own
time. That makes me wonder how this applies to teaching programming. How
much responsibility am I putting on the students to understand concepts,
and how could I judiciously apply repetition and questioning to make
people learn whether they want to or not?</p>
<p>This is really how these language lessons work. If you're listening, you
have no choice but to learn. There's a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.audible.com/pd/?asin=B0036GTIUI">free sample of the Japanese
version</a> and other
languages on Audible, if you're curious to hear how it works.</p>
<p>(Update: I also <a class="reference external" href="https://www.jpichon.net/blog/2011/10/learning-japanese/">posted on what I did after the Foundation
Course</a>, and
ideas on what to do after finishing the Advanced Course)</p>
