Rule</a>:
Building a civilised workplace and surviving one that isn't&quot; by Robert
Sutton is a short and interesting read. To understand what it's about,
the title and subtitle say it all!</p>
<p>The definition of an asshole for the book goes like this: they do or say
something that makes the target feel worse about themselves, and they
target people who are less powerful.</p>
<p>The book goes on describing negative effects of assholes, at many
different levels: emotional, organisational, and even financial, handy
should you ever need a $$$ breakdown to make your bosses or company
understand why it would be helpful to get rid of the assholes or at
least prevent them taking over the company and culture. There'll be a
lot of echoes and parallels you can draw with a few unhealthy
open-source communities (e.g. earning the right to be a jerk once you've
proven your technical chops, etc.), particularly if you've seen the
excellent <a class="reference external" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSFDm3UYkeE">Poisonous
people</a> tech talk.</p>
<p>Other interesting aspects covered in the book include how to survive
assholes when you really have no other choice, without becoming one
yourself, and also what to do when <em>you</em> are the asshole. I thought that
was really interesting! It's easy to get reading and imagine yourself as
the recipient or appalled onlooker rather than the asshole dishing it
out, but truth is we've all had our bad days. The book truly aims to be
thorough, even touching on the benefits of behaving like an asshole, and
how setting up a 'no asshole' policy can backfire: if it's only lip
service, suddenly you become an hypocrite in addition to being an
asshole.</p>
<p>Reading the book, it's obvious and clear that maintaining and
establishing a workplace with a &quot;no asshole&quot; rule is a much better and
healthier alternative for everyone, assholes included, and for
organisations themselves. Hopefully the book will also act as a guide
and help for people who want to expose, flee or get rid of the assholes
around them.</p>
