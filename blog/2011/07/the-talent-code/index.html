Code</a>
brings us on a tour of the brain to explain how talent is acquired,
weaving the science (and sometimes bold assumptions about the reptilian
brain) with plenty of illustrative stories and anecdotes reminiscent of
Gladwell's
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.jpichon.net/blog/2010/12/outliers-malcolm-gladwell/">Outliers</a>.
Basically there's no such thing as &quot;innate talent&quot;, only hard work :-)
The 10,000 hours rule is mentioned a few times.</p>
<p>We learn that it's all about the myelin, a substance that wraps around
synapses to make the signal between 2 neurons less likely to &quot;leak&quot; and
therefore makes the impulse arrive stronger and faster. This explains
why, as we become more skilled at something, it feels more effortless.
This is also why there is no shortcut for practice: to become good at
something, you need to fire the signal over and over again to build
myelin around the right synapse/behaviour you want to excel at. This
cannot be done by reading books, where different signals would be fired.</p>
<p>The premise for the book is the author's curiosity with regard to
&quot;talent hotbeds&quot;, these places in the world that seem to consistently
produce top talent -- be it in football, classical music, tennis, etc.
We follow the author in his travels and interviews, and while looking at
these places with him we come back again and again to myelin, while also
realising the importance of &quot;deep practice&quot; and why it makes a huge
difference when learning a skill.</p>
<p>We also look at ignition, the initial motivator that gets someone
started learning a skill, as well as how one's environment and personal
circumstances impact the likelihood that they will keep at it until they
become an expert. Ignition needs to be fuelled to sustain motivation,
and having an environment full of cues that tell you that &quot;you should
learn this, you should do this&quot; helps -- cues that talent hotbeds appear
to have in abundance.</p>
<p>Great coaches and teachers are also mentioned, including references to
studies that investigate what these people do that make them great. For
instance one study discovered that 75% of the remarks imparted by a
coach during training were purely informational and offered at key
moments, as opposed to constant compliments or criticisms.</p>

<div class="line">There are a couple of pictures and diagrams included, cuts of
myelinated (huh... spelling?) cells, others to explain the myelination
process. Very cool!</div>
