</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>As part of my quest of becoming better at public speaking, I recently
finished reading <a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Presentation-Zen-Simple-Design-Delivery/dp/0321525655/">Presentation
Zen</a>.
The first striking thing about the book is how beautifully designed it
is all along (probably another one that wouldn't work well on an
e-reader), which of course highlights the principles the book aims to
impart.</p>
<p>The structure flows well, and every chapter contains lots of tips and
clear steps to look at when preparing a presentation. Often a chapter
will offer some background on why something work, or why you should try
to get away from the traditional (and boring) way of doing
presentations. Also why it might be difficult to do so, depending on the
culture you live in.</p>
<p>The book is nowhere only about slides, but in the chapters about
designing and preparing them I really enjoyed that there were so many
examples, including &quot;before&quot; (traditional) and &quot;after&quot; (following the
presentation zen principles). Mostly what the book really describes is a
general attitude one should develop with regard to presenting, preparing
for a presentation and respecting your audience.</p>
<p>It's an absolutely fantastic read if you want to get better at
presenting and generally get away from being boring and hampered by
bullet points, but you don't know where to start.</p>
<p>I'm trying these new principles now for my Sugar talk. I think it
definitely improved my preparation, by helping me think more about flow
and using slides to support what I say rather than as a crutch. When it
comes to being able to deliver the talk though, it'll be another story.
We'll see!</p>
