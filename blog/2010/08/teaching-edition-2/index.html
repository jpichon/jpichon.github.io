</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>Last Monday I started teaching my introduction to programming course,
edition #2 to a small group of adults this time. Here are a few thoughts
from the evening.</p>
<div class="section" id="installing-python-and-an-ide">
<h2>Installing Python and an IDE</h2>
<p>First of all, as expected getting Python to work on multiple platforms
as well as more or less getting everyone to use the same editor was a
misery. I settled on having Geany or IDLE in the end. We kinda gave up
on Windows, though I got some additional info from a friend since then
that should be helpful if necessary. Despite that experience, I would
expect just as much pain next time. Note to self: bring several usb
sticks with all the binaries to pass around, one isn't enough. I wish
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.geany.org">Geany</a> would work out of the box with Python
on any platform, that would be so awesome and convenient. It really is a
great IDE!</p>
<p>I was briefly pondering whether it'd make sense to simply make everyone
use Ubuntu (e.g. as a LiveCD, with a usb stick to save), but
<a class="reference external" href="http://twitter.com/_janem">Jannette</a> made a good point that people
would likely never look at it again after the course.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="pace">
<h2>Pace</h2>
<p>I suspect one, perhaps two people are a bit frustrated by the pace but I
think it works for most otherwise. I'm not interested in rushing through
concepts in any case, but next time I may have to work even harder at
explaining that this course is an introduction to programming, not to
Python.</p>
<p>It would appear I've somewhat learnt to size my lessons better. To be
verified at the next session though, I had no control over how long the
installation phase lasted.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="preparations">
<h2>Preparations</h2>
<p>For the material, I reused and expanded on my lessons from last time. As
before, I had the same issue with the lack of exercises for simple
concepts, although I still believe they matter a lot. If people miss
anything at this point they will struggle to the end. I must find and
create more of those. (Ideas welcome! Mostly exercises to do with text
display/variables/user input, and nothing more.)</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="interacting-with-the-students">
<h2>Interacting with the students</h2>
<p>I didn't like when someone popped in and was a bit disruptive, making
disparaging comments about Python and comparing concepts with other
languages. I don't think it's helpful to do that when someone is
learning them for the first time, you need to give a chance to let
concepts sink in before explaining variations. I was very bummed out by
the whole episode and also by my reaction, all in all it was a very
light hearted interruption and if I want to become a better teacher and
go back to teaching teenagers, I really need to stay cool and not get
flustered. Cutting myself some slack this time, I'm still an apprentice
and this is the first time teaching in the big outside world, but
definitely something to keep an eye on and improve upon...</p>
<p>Overall adult students are a lot more active than when I taught younger
people! They ask a lot of questions, which makes me very happy :) It
does make sense, the whole &quot;I have lots of adult responsibilities
therefore very little time, if I show up, sacrificing the time I could
be using to do other things, and also pay money for something I will
make the most of it!&quot; Or well, that is my theory behind this variation
so far.</p>
<p>I hope the students will feel free to share more of what what works and
doesn't as the courses goes on. I definitely plan on asking for overall
course feedback at the end, and hope people will share their thoughts to
give me a chance to improve :)</p>
<p>I got some helpful feedback already:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>I was told I went too fast on explaining int(), what it is, the
conversion and why it's needed. The truth is once again I ended up
giving an exercise that required using int() to convert user input
and forgot to spend time explaining it properly beforehand. Grumbles!</li>
<li>So far, <a class="reference external" href="http://identi.ca/conversation/46829068">Mike is happy</a>
\o/</li>
