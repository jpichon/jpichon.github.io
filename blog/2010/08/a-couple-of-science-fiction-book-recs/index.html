</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>For the past few years I read very few, if any, fiction at all. Techie
books, check, biographies and other real-life-documentary-like books,
sure, but for some reason I couldn't stick to fiction storylines
anymore.</p>
<p>Then a couple months ago I rehashed an old pet peeve of mine to a
friend, about how most science-fiction books try so hard to focus on an
idea that they don't care about making interesting, believable
characters and sometimes don't ever bother that much with plot either.
It's all about &quot;the idea&quot; and it makes for a dull read, that has been
keeping me mostly away from SF literature.</p>
<p>In response I was lent &quot;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Flowers-Algernon-Masterworks-Daniel-Keyes/dp/1857989384">Flowers for
Algernon</a>&quot;
by Daniel Keyes, and wow, what that interesting and moving and with
absolutely non-bland characters! I really enjoyed it, and finished it in
a few days once I actually took the time to sit down and start it. It
was a very good read. The summary on the back cover kinda gives away a
lot, but it doesn't take at all from the story, because the point is
following the main character's evolution and changes and personality and
struggles. I hear there's a movie too, I'd like to watch it at some
point.</p>
<p>Then a couple of weeks back, I was walking in Waterstones and saw a book
with this <a class="reference external" href="http://www.chris-beckett.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/chris-beckett-turing-test.jpg">awesome
cover</a>
(and a title that can only attract a software developer, &quot;The Turing
Test&quot;!) Who cares about not judging a book by its cover, it inspired me.
It's actually a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Turing-Test-Chris-Beckett/dp/0955318181/">collection of short
stories</a>
by Chris Beckett, who I hadn't heard of before (the introduction by
Alistair Reynolds is interesting in a meta sort of way), and the stories
are just fantastic. They use SF as a way of exploring inherently human
concepts like identity, life, art, soul, with characters that are
profoundly humans (except when they're not... or are they, really?) and
endearing. The stories suck you right in. Many of the worlds keep
vividly haunting my mind long after I moved on to the next story. Some
of the stories overlap, either set in the same world at different times
or having you meet similar characters or concepts again. It's awesome. I
loved it. I'd say I loved them all but I actually had a bit of trouble
understanding the first story which gives its name to the book... Do not
let this stop you!! Keep reading!</p>
<p>After this, the next time I saw another book by the same author, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Holy-Machine-Chris-Beckett/dp/1848876564/">Holy
Machine</a>,
I acquired it and happily realised it was set in the same world than one
of the stories I really-really enjoyed in the Turing Test, likely set a
bit later in the world's history. It was a delightful read and I
finished it in a couple of days. Recommended too! I'll definitely keep
looking out for the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.chris-beckett.com/books/">author's other
books</a>. :)</p>
<p>Thanks for hooking me again on reading fiction, Barry!</p>
