</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>I surface again, back from the land of studying and cramming. I decided
to study for the SCJP (Sun Certified Java Programmer) exam, since that's
what I spend my time doing at $dayjob (I might as well do it as best as
I can!) Yesterday I passed the exam, yay!</p>
<p>I kinda like exams and certifications and courses in general (though if
you'd asked me on Sunday I likely would have had something different to
say!) They give a focus to my learning or simply give me the opportunity
to look into a topic -- I'm interested in many many things and although
I plan to learn about them all at some point, I can't learn everything
at once. I was delighted when a JQuery course was organised in
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.tog.ie/">Tog</a> earlier this year, it was the perfect
opportunity to get a taste for it.</p>
<p>My usual process for learning a programming language usually starts like
this:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Do something. I first used Perl when I had a huge QIF export where I
needed to change the dates from DD/MM/YY to MM/DD/YY. Or maybe it was
the other way around.</li>
<li>Or follow a tutorial to learn about it. Django looked so cool I had
to try out their awesome, awesome tutorial.</li>
<li>Sometimes I'll pick up a book on the topic if I see a good
recommendation, like <em>Learning Perl</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Very quickly though, I'll usually get interested in a problem or app and
I'll drop the tutorials and books, simply using them as reference
materials. It's the best way to learn, my practical knowledge expands
but at the same time I'm likely to miss on things because I don't know
they exist, or I don't realise I only have a partial understanding of a
particular topic. In the end I only learn and see what I need for
whatever task at hand, my knowledge can be fuzzy in places. I build a
good feel for what's right and wrong but I don't necessarily understand
precisely why. There could be a world of useful features I'm missing,
especially if the new language has its own very specific quirks and
shortcuts that don't always map one-to-one to other languages -- Perl
comes to mind!</p>
<p>So that's why I enjoy studying for a certification or course, it gives
me a different focus. Sometimes I even learn things that could end up
being useful! ( ;) ) Some I'm sure will help me debug tough issues in
the future, others I'll want to try out in my next project. I enjoy my
new understanding of why some things work and why others don't.</p>
<p>Right now though, what I'm really looking forward to is having the time
again to read other, non-Java related books!</p>
