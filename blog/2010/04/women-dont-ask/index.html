</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>I discovered this book thanks to Valerie Aurora, <a class="reference external" href="http://valerieaurora.org/ask.html">looking up her
website</a> after hearing her speak
at <a class="reference external" href="http://www.skycon.skynet.ie/2007/">SkyCon '07</a>. It's taken me a
while to get around to reading it but it was very worthwhile. I would
recommend reading Val's review of it, which I linked above and will link
again because <a class="reference external" href="http://valerieaurora.org/ask.html">it's a really good
review</a>. I don't know if the book
has &quot;changed&quot; my life just yet, but it's certainly been making me think
a hell of a lot, it's made me more observant of the subtle -- or
non-subtle I had totally missed until now because they seem so &quot;normal&quot;
-- ways in which girls and boys are treated and the expectations that
are put upon them from early on, and how people (of both genders) react
to things differently depending on the gender of the person who said or
did it.</p>
<p>I really enjoyed all the studies described all along the book, as well
as the insights the book provides in understanding where a lot of social
expectations and pressures come from and how they shape and affect how
people, including myself, behave or react to others' actions. Knowing
this is helpful to understand people's behaviour better and hopefully
would encourage the readers, no matter their gender, to negotiate better
for themselves. I look forward to having a look at &quot;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Ask-Women-Really-Power-Negotiation/dp/0749927844/">Ask for
it</a>&quot;,
the follow-up book which focuses on giving actual strategies to improve
negotiation skills.</p>
