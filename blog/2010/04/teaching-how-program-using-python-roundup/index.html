</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>Over a few weeks, I taught a group of 6 teenagers, complete beginners,
how to program using Python as the main language to illustrate concepts
and to code examples. There were 4 sessions lasting 3 hours each. The
final session was about 3 weeks ago and since then I've been trying to
tie all the little bits of knowledge and experience from this into a
neat knot, to extract some lessons learnt and do better next time.</p>
<p>I probably waited a bit too long... At the same time perhaps this is
giving me some much needed perspective. I've had many discussions about
the whole thing, mostly the parts where I feel I failed because they
tend to shine the loudest in my mind :) But writing the introduction to
this blog post I realised, &quot;4 sessions,&quot; well, perhaps I need to cut
myself some slack as well.</p>
<div class="section" id="problem-outline">
<h2>Problem: Outline</h2>
<p>From the very beginning of the course, it was clear and obvious that I
had a hell of a lot to learn in scheduling and outlining my lessons, as
my ideas of how much we could accomplish in one session were widly,
widly, wiiiidly off. I remember telling the course organiser before the
first session started, &quot;I'm sorry, do you have a backup to keep them
busy for the final hour in case I don't have enough material?&quot;,
convinced that it would be hard to last more than 2 hours with what I
had.</p>
<p>In the end it took about 10 hours (out of a 12 hours course) to go
through the material I had put together for this first session. Heh!</p>
<p>I was hoping we would have time to do some fun stuff with pygame
notably, because I think graphics feel more rewarding to code,
especially when you're young as it's easier to show off to your family
and friends what you've been up to. I'm not giving up on finding a way
to put this together for the next course I will be teaching to
teenagers, maybe next September (to be confirmed!)</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="problem-knowing-how-to-program-vs-thinking-like-a-programmer">
<h2>Problem: Knowing how to program vs. thinking like a programmer</h2>
<p>The stingiest disappointment for me (and thus the one that's been on my
mind the most since then) was the very last session. For once I had
actually planned my time more or less correctly: first we would see how
to read and write to a file, then for the final 2 hours there would be a
cool exercise building up on everything we'd seen so far: a simple rot13
encryption/decryption program, where the encryption program asks for
input, encrypts it and writes it to a file ; while the decryption would
be about reading the file and decrypting it back.</p>
<p>That was a catastrophe. Although the students had always managed to make
their way through the one or two-liner exercises with varying amount of
sweating depending on the concept at hand, they just didn't know where
to start, or what to do next after I gave them a few clues and the
beginning of a solution. About halfway through this it dawned on me that
although I had taught them how to program, I hadn't taught them how to
think like programmers. They were unable to decompose the problem into
manageable steps that they knew how to solve.</p>
<p>That's absolutely my failure of course, that day I left the room very
discouraged and wondering whether it was worthwhile for me to pursue
this again. After a few nights of sleep, hell yeah, I'm motivated to
learn from my mistakes and make new ones until I figure out the whole
thing. Speaking with <a class="reference external" href="http://www.lczajkowski.com">Laura</a> at OSS
BarCamp was quite encouraging as well ; she's organised many (most!)
awesome open-source events in Ireland and yet, told me that she still
gets some things wrong. I also started looking at some <a class="reference external" href="http://ocw.mit.edu">MIT Open
CourseWare</a> courses on education, going through
some of the material and getting interesting book references ('How
people learn' looks awesome!) I want to parse and digest as much
research on education as I can, understand better how learning works and
what teaching methods are effective and in the end, keep the bits that
matter to what I'm doing.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="improvements-for-next-time">
<h2>Improvements for next time</h2>
<p>Regarding the schedule and outlining the course, I think it will take
experience for me to get it righter. I now know to take it easy, allow
lots of time for new concepts from the very beginning, prepare exercises
at different levels to keep the students that get it faster busy. I'll
be teaching version 0.2 of that course to adults starting next month,
and I'm wondering whether I should assume that the pace will be a bit
faster. I don't think that grown-ups are more intelligent, or have more
aptitude than a bunch of 15 year old. What I suspect is that when you
make the time in the midst of all your other grown-up responsibilities
and time commitments, to take a course and possibly even cash out money
for it, you're more focused and motivated to learn. While teenagers
might not perceive learning with as much awareness, when they're likely
doing an activity because it's been organised for them or they had to
pick an option to fill their timetable. I'm not sure whether or how that
will impact the pace of the course (any thoughts?), but I will try to
allow for that.</p>
<p>With regard to learning to think like a programmer, I think I will try
to include more reading of code particularly when introducing new
concepts, perhaps even writing them as pseudo-code to not distract with
the syntax and language quirks. What I mainly did this time was
introduce 2 or 3 liner toy examples, then building on them, with the
students writing the program at the same time as I do. It sounds
straightforward but it isn't necessarily, as they haven't trained
themselves yet to watch for stray whitespace or missing colons. It's a
good way of getting in the habit of watching out for your indentation
and other silly programming traps. And by the end they were getting used
to it indeed :) But still, reading as in taking the time to think about
what you're doing and how you are going to achieve the next step was
sorely missing. I want to include sections where we go through existing
small programs to understand their logic, and I want to go through small
problems and show how to decompose them into smaller problems. To be
honest, not doing that last one was perhaps a bit of a cop-out. It's
easier to give exercises and help people as they encounter difficulties,
rather than talk to a room of distracted students who usually don't give
any feedback on whether things make any sense or if they are even
listening :) I will work on that.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="feedback">
<h2>Feedback</h2>
<p>In the end, while it's clear that the course wasn't perfect and I have
much to learn and improve on, it certainly wasn't all bad. Before we
started on the ill-fated rot13 exercise, I gave the students a <a class="reference external" href="https://www.jpichon.net/site_media/teaching/Feedback_Form.pdf">feedback
form</a> on
the course and got 3.5 data points out of it (a kid was sick, another
was missing, and one kid filled in half the form about a different
activity that was occurring in parallel). (Side-note: I'm learning to
create feedback forms on the fly, but I think if you're going for
qualitative rather than quantitative, easy to aggregate data I heartily
recommend the &quot;3 words to describe the course/training/whatever&quot;
approach. It's a great way to get people's overall impression and
feelings on the course. Keeping in mind that if the forms aren't
anonymous, people are less likely to be honest about negative aspects.)
The students were generally happy about the course, with words like
&quot;worthwhile&quot; and &quot;cool&quot; coming up often, about as often as &quot;hard&quot; ;) So
it was difficult but they got something out of it, and didn't feel like
they were wasting their time. I didn't turn anybody completely off
programming, which was a major fear of mine when starting this
(victory!)</p>
<p>Onward to becoming a better teacher!</p>
