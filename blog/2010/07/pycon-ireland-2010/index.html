<h2>Saturday</h2>
<p>Many interesting talks and presentations on Saturday, mostly on
different aspects of web development (saw 2 on measuring and improving
UI performance), one on Clojure (I'm glad I know more about it though I
still don't feel interested enough to want to give it a go yet) (Scheme
is higher on the list!), a dynamic introduction to writing your own XMPP
bot. There's a few talks like the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.python.ie/pyconireland/2010/conference#talk-python-puzzlers">Python
puzzlers</a>
I want to catch on video when they're available. I saw lots of people
with N900 around and oh, how I lust.</p>
<p>The venue could have used some air conditioning but besides that it was
great, especially in the afternoon once there was more talks going on at
the same time, so the rooms were less likely to be filled up. The
corridors were not blocked but because the space was still, let's say
cosy you would often end up besides someone and just strike random nerdy
conversations. I really enjoyed that and met some very interesting
people.</p>
<p>The evening was very well organised as well. Tasty dinner in the
Radisson then live music, way too loud like Irish people tend to like
(?), but after moving away a tiny bit further with a couple of attendees
I met at the bar&nbsp; we were able to talk about Tog and other topics. Lots
of people asked me about the hackerspace over the week-end actually (I
was proudly wearing my Tog tee-shirt on Saturday!), it's great to see
people so curious and inspired by the idea.</p>
<div class="line-block">

<h2>Sunday</h2>
<p>I'd never been to a Python sprint before so I wasn't sure at all how it
organises / self-organises. I felt very inspired by the XMPP talk from
the day before (such simplicity, and yet, such power!) and I wanted to
give a go at the sample bot the speaker, Victor Hugo, had published on
GitHub before the talk. So I ended up with <a class="reference external" href="http://whykay.tumblr.com/post/828109853/what-was-happening-at-pyconireland-sprints-today">my name on a
whiteboard</a>
besides XMPP, heh heh. At the beginning of the day one of the organisers
asked us what we wanted to &quot;lead a session on&quot; and put the names, topics
and rooms on a whiteboard. People were free to add up other topics as
the day went along, or drop by on a session they were interested in.</p>
<p>Overall this felt like one of Tog's synchronous hackathon except more
organised. I was delighted when someone showed up a bit later who was
curious about XMPP too and sat besides me so we could work at figuring
it out together. Having the speaker sitting nearby was handy too to
answer questions on some aspects of XMPP communication through Python.
After having the basic code running I decided to try to scrap my
favourite dictionary website, wordreference.com to get basic English to
French / French to English word translation. It took me longer to
remember how to work with BeautifulSoup than adding the XMPP command but
still, it works and was good fun. (<a class="reference external" href="http://github.com/jpichon/botnet">The code is
here!</a>)</p>
<p>After the tasty lunch at Boticelli, I went to the &quot;Python: building
community&quot; session, which touched on topics&nbsp; like enabling newcomers to
join the community and feel welcome, how the existence of a Python
certification would help increase Python visibility and credibility with
employers, and then one of my favourite topics, outreach to students and
younger people. I got a lot of energy out of that last part and I'm
motivated to set up my &quot;introduction to programming using Python&quot;
workshop/course that has been postponed since June. More on that on this
blog soon. We talked about organising quarterly events such as sprints,
particularly aiming to involve university students which should be great
fun too.</p>

<p>I'm delighted with my (quite exhausting!) week-end, and very thankful to
the conference organisers for enabling us to have such an awesome time.
Very energising, or as I should be saying: it was great craic.</p>
