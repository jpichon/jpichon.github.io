</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.stonesintoschools.com">Stones into Schools</a> is the
follow-up story to <a class="reference external" href="https://www.jpichon.net/blog/2010/04/three-cups-of-tea/">Three cups of
tea</a>, starting
in 2003 where we left Greg Mortenson looking to expand the Central Asia
Institute mission to building schools in Afghanistan. As expected the
story is just as engaging and fascinating as the one narrated in the
first book, and beautifully advocates for education, especially girl
education and promoting literacy for girls and women. It also offers a
candid view of life in countries suffering from their proximity or
association with the Talibans, and of people and their daily life that's
otherwise difficult to grasp from only watching the news.</p>
<p>It's heartbreaking to read about their work and the descriptions of
horrors and tragedies during the earthquake in Pakistan in 2005, when
nearly every day we hear about the terrible flooding the country is now
suffering from. I wonder how many schools and CAI schools are affected
and if the CAI is able to help...</p>
<p>Despite and around all this, I found myself getting excited and worried
and anxious every time the CAI &quot;Dirty Dozen&quot; worked their ass off to get
a new school built, as each always seems to bring so much suspense and
so many challenges. I think their school tally is up to 131, at the end
of this book completed around August 2009.</p>
<p>The story gives an interesting perspective on the American military,
that I certainly appreciated as someone usually suspicious of that
establishment. Conversely, the narrator isn't always very kind when
comparing the CAI work style with that of other NGOs working in those
areas. Other NGOs tend to appear out of touch, e.g. traversing poor
areas in expensive black SUVs with gigantic antennas... Perhaps the
sentiment is justified.</p>
<p>A minor grip I have with the book would be a writing style quirk whereby
every few pages a section ends with a phrasing like &quot;but little did they
know blah blah&quot;, it feels a bit like a cheap trick especially used so
heavily, when it's unnecessary considering how compelling the story is
on its own merit.</p>
<p>This really is a fantastic, inspiring and instructive story, I would
recommend to anyone with either an interest in education or who
generally enjoys reading to give one of these two books a try.</p>
