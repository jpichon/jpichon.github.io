<h2>The talks</h2>
<p>I attended the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.python.ie/meetup/2010/sept_2010_talks__the_science_gallery/">September event of Python
Ireland</a>
yesterday night, another great meetup! The first talk ended up being the
long awaited &quot;<strong>Distributed profiling with Redis</strong>&quot;, instead of
'buildout' as the speaker was sick (initially the Redis talk was planned
for August, but got postponed due to sickness as well... Could the
Python folks be more fragile?!). That talk made me curious to look more
into profiling, and to also dig into what other gems Python core might
be hiding. Sadly the only command I remember out of the talk is this:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
python -m cProfile --sort=cumulative my_program.py
</pre>
<p>but I'm sure that'll be enough to come up with some awesome things! I'll
poke a bit at the examples once the speaker makes his code available. It
was the sort of code that jumps at your face in a &quot;OMG what is this all
about!&quot; kind of way but I'm sure it'll make more sense once I can
actually play with it. It was built such that it could also be used as,
say, a profiling middleware in Django, which sounds fairly cool.</p>
<p>There was then a lightning talk by Rory about &quot;<strong>Lambada</strong>&quot;, a way to do
functional programming using Python. I wish I had a code example to show
what this was all about, but. At the same time, I mostly don't. It was
funny though! ;)</p>
<p>Alan concluded the talks with &quot;<strong>Python for Cloud Computing</strong>&quot; which
gave us a nice overview of the different cloud services available out
there, and what kind of Python is available for them. Infrastructure as
a Service, Platform as a Service, Software as a Service, Google
AppEngine with Python (limited to certain modules, no C allowed), Google
AppEngine with Java and Jython (good for XSLT), all with NoSQL
databases, Amazon Web Services with EC2 and S3 and, stuff. Very
buzzword-full but with explanations too!
<a class="reference external" href="http://code.google.com/p/boto/">Boto</a> looks like a very nice Python
API to explore, as a front-end to communicate with AWS.</p>

<h2>The pub</h2>
<p>We ended the evening in the lovely Trinity Capital Hotel again, where
Vishal showed a few of us the Python app he wrote for his Android phone
and some of the code, in preparation for his
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.ossbarcamp.com">OSSBarCamp</a> talk. Many people asked me
how the course was going, which delighted me, people are really curious
about it! I nearly feel bad that I don't have many Python-related
nuggets to share, I'm mostly learning how to teach. It would all be a
hell of a lot harder to do without Python, but at the same time there is
no &quot;Python is awesome!!&quot; chant at the beginning of every session nor
Python prayers at the end. It's just the language we use and have fun
learning with.</p>
<p>I brought up with a few people my idea of teaching a Python &quot;crash
course&quot; over an afternoon, for people with previous programming
experience. I was actually kind of losing enthusiasm about it, thinking
about standing up in front of a bunch of hardcore programmers ready to
dish out all sorts of real-life flaming but people thought it was pretty
cool and had helpful suggestions. I guess I was kind of forgetting that
it would be mostly people with an interest in learning rather than
common Internet trolls :) The idea would be to get everyone's
environment set up, have a quick overview of the syntax (I reckon no
more than 20-30 minutes) and then give people something to do to have
them cut their teeth on a cool Python project. It wouldn't happen before
November, but I'll need to find a few good ideas -- suggestions
welcome!! It could be real fun, done well.</p>
