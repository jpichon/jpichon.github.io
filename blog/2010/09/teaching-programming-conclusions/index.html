</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>Last Monday was the last session of my short &quot;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.tog.ie/2010/08/python/">Introduction to
programming, with Python</a>&quot; class.
Eight adults signed up, the course lasted for 5 weeks on Monday evenings
and overall the impressions are positive. I made progress in places, and
learnt how to improve in others.</p>
<div class="section" id="expanding">
<h2>Expanding</h2>
<p>I didn't write last week, though my main thought at the time was that I
would really like to expand the course. Likely it's linked to teaching
such a nice crowd in such a nice atmosphere! I did know 3 people before
they took the course, with helped get the banter started early on. Note
to self: breaks are important for reasons mentioned before, but also
because they enable students to chat together and get to know each
other.</p>
<p>I wouldn't go about making the course longer without having the material
ready beforehand though. Despite having a lot of material already for
the first 3 sessions, I underestimated how exhausting teaching and
preparing the material would wind up being. With the rest of &quot;Life&quot; in
general filling many other evenings, I ended up with little breathing
time and thinking time. Must prepare more!</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="difficulty-levels">
<h2>Difficulty levels</h2>
<p>Although I had taken the time to break down the exercises further than I
did the first time, and spent more time on explaining file handling and
a few string manipulation functions, rot13 ended up being waaay over
everyone's head again. It breaks my heart but I think I will have to
give up on that exercise for now! I love the idea because it brings
every concept studied so far so nicely together. However going from 3-10
lines exercises to 25+ is too much of a leap. If I want to reintroduce
rot13 I need to build up a better progression up to that level.</p>
<p>Something I'm thinking about trying in the meantime: give exercises with
code partially written, and ask students to fill in the blanks. That way
we can go straight to the interesting sections without getting bogged
down with stuff that is not as relevant at that particular moment.</p>
<p>I introduced functions during the last session... Should I teach again
over 5+ sessions I would reverse the topics of 4 and 5 to have more time
to explain functions and solve more related exercises.</p>
<p>In general it's obvious people started having more issues from session 4
(confirmed by the feedback form and chit chats) and that the flow was
not as good. The difficulty seems to start from the &quot;For loop&quot;
exercises, studied the previous week, so I'll be going over them as well
before teaching the course again.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="scheduling">
<h2>Scheduling</h2>
<p>This was the first time I had time to introduce functions. My initial
assessment, after my first scheduling successes, that I had learnt how
much to fit in one session was mistaken. It turns out that when teaching
a concept for the first time I still seriously underestimate how much I
take for granted (say, what is meant when I say to &quot;call&quot; the function),
and therefore how long it will take to explain (...and to make up for
the information I unintentionally left out).</p>
<p>Although I get some of the &quot;details&quot; of scheduling wrong, I still think
I've gotten better at both guessing what will fit in 1 hour as well as
how much new content I want to go through during one session (that's
important too!). Perhaps I'll outline my next course in 1 hour
increments.</p>
<p>I'm very happy with how sessions 1 to 3 went (so are the students,
according to the feedback form!) -- although I could do with more very
simple exercises for the first session, only using print/variables and
perhaps user input. I'm guessing it went well because those are the
concepts I taught previously and I was able to improve my initial
explanations based on the feedback and misunderstandings of my first
teaching experience. I had also taught session 4 and file handling, but
it didn't go well because of the rot13 exercise, and my attempts to
introduce the concepts in more depth and to break down the exercises
were insufficient once again.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="student-feedback">
<h2>Student feedback</h2>
<p>Disclaimer: There is obviously a bias to the feedback, in that although
the form was anonymous I was in the same room, and by then the students
knew me a little too!</p>
<p>Most people are happy, and the course either matched or exceeded their
expectations, which is, yay \o/</p>
<p>My favourite questions is &quot;3 words to describe the course&quot;. As before,
very often it contains a mix of &quot;challenging&quot;, &quot;hard&quot; together with
&quot;interesting&quot; or &quot;enjoyable&quot;. My goal exactly :o)</p>
<p>The leap in difficulty between the first 3 sessions and 4 &amp; 5 came back
several times (well, I did hand the feedback form after students had
spent 1h making excruciatingly slow progress on rot13).</p>
<p>Surprisingly, there was a vote in favour of mandatory homework, to help
keep the momentum in between sessions. I think I will try some version
of that next time I teach to adults. Often the exercises for the next
sessions were available beforehand, but that wasn't quite sufficient for
people to find the time to look at them. I'm not sure if I would do it
when teaching to high school teens again though, when I would be
competing against all sorts of other boring and/or important homework
assignments.</p>
<p>Someone mentioned wishing it was clearer how that stuff was used in
other programs. That's something I'll think about so that it is, next
time.</p>
<p>Several people mentioned wishing the course was longer or that they
would sign up for a &quot;level 2&quot; follow-up to the course. Should I want to
do this, I don't think it would happen in time for this particular
instance. I have too much to do in the next couple of months, and
waiting any longer we probably would have to start looking at the very
basics again. That's unfortunate, though I'll keep thinking about it and
possible alternatives.</p>
<p>I want to expand the course next time so we can look at a couple more
concepts and spend more time on others, but I'm not convinced in general
by the idea of teaching more courses levels... When does it stop? At
some point one has to find a problem they want to solve for themselves
and start programming on their own. Perhaps the course is a bit too
self-contained at the moment. I should try to open up more
possibilities, rather than solving in class every problem we encounter
(well... or do it more gracefully to avoid the nasty feelings left from
rot13!) Someone suggested giving links to websites with
Python/programming exercises, which sounds like a great next step for
people to explore.</p>
