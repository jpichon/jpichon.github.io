of them.</p>
<p><img alt="Gnome foot" src="https://www.jpichon.net/site_media/images/gnome.png" /></p>
<div class="section" id="gnome-bugsquad">
<h2>Gnome Bugsquad</h2>
<p>The first talk was about <a class="reference external" href="http://fosdem.org/2010/schedule/events/gnome_bugsquad">bug triaging in
Gnome</a>. I
can't believe there are only 5 active bug triagers in the project (as
in, people fully focused on cleaning up the bug database). Tobias
Mueller, the happy and dynamic speaker, made a good job explaining why
this is such an important task, as the bug tracker is basically a window
to the world. This is what people will be confronted with when they try
to interact with the project, and having unanswered bugs lingering
around doesn't give a very good impression.</p>
<p>In itself, bug triaging is a great entry point into the project because
it doesn't require in-depth knowledge and it brings you closer to the
community as you get to know the developers by name, so it's a good way
to get involved, learn more about Gnome and help out.</p>
<p>The way triaging work:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>There are bugs. People find them and complain about them in the bug
tracker.</li>
<li>We need to understand and get all the necessary information for the
developer to be able to fix it.</li>
<li>So the status of the bug needs to be kept accurate (more on that
later)</li>
<li>And bug triagers can identify severe issues, such as bugs that come
back often or many times so we can inform the adequate people.</li>
</ul>
<p>I love that quote: <strong>&quot;Bug triaging is about making people happy.&quot;</strong> We
want our users to be happy, Gnome is about the people in the end!</p>
<p>Some other happy mottos:</p>
<p>&quot;Be nice, be friendly, be happy.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Answer early, answer often.&quot;</p>
<p>There are several ways to get in touch, through IRC, the mailing list,
they're trying to hold bug days but currently lack the manpower to do
so. They have a triage guide that is apparently so awesome even the KDE
guys use it! :D <a class="reference external" href="http://live.gnome.org/Bugsquad/TriageGuide">Here's a
link</a>, I have to carve
out time to read it.</p>
<p>After showing us some tools to find duplicate bugs and what sort of
information to ask for, Toby walked us through the different statuses
and how to use them, like what to do if you can't get information from
the bug reporter after 6 weeks (the assumption is that this is not a
problem anymore so resolve the bug), or if you're triaging a bug from
more than 2 releases ago (resolve it as obsolete). Some statuses are
reserved for the module maintainers. It's all summarised in a <a class="reference external" href="http://live.gnome.org/Bugsquad/TriageGuide?action=AttachFile&amp;do=view&amp;target=Diagram_triagers.png">shiny
diagram available on the
wiki</a>.
When you start out you actually can't modify the status yourself, so you
should add a comment explaining why you think the status should be
updated and someone with the Power on #bugs will change it for you.
Quickly enough, once you've shown you understand how this works, you can
ask for the ability to change statuses yourself.</p>
<p>The final statement was that they need people and it's a good way to
start if you want to get involved, it's not too hard for beginners and
it doesn't cost too much time or requires that much knowledge. And you
get to know the people and projects.</p>
<p>To get started:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Create a Bugzilla account,</li>
<li>Read the wiki,</li>
<li>Ask questions on IRC,</li>
<li>Get started. You can't do anything yet, so write it in the comments,</li>
<li>If it all makes sense ask for access to do it yourself.</li>
</ol>
<p>At the end, he asked who he convinced, I think he should have asked who
would consider contributing to bug triaging, that's less commitment
while still showing interest :) I joined the ML while he was speaking
but I didn't raise my hand when he asked, because my way of doing things
is to lurk for a while and then see if/how I can fit something in my
schedule, rather than making promises I will break. We'll see how that
one goes! I'd love to get more involved with Gnome.</p>

<h2>Adding plugins to your Gnome apps</h2>
<p>Steve Fr√©cinaux <a class="reference external" href="http://fosdem.org/2010/schedule/events/gnome_apps_plugins">talked to
us</a> about
libpeas, a framework being developed to make plugin development within
Gnome applications easier and more consistent across applications.</p>
<p><img alt="Plate of peas" src="https://www.jpichon.net/site_media/images/fosdem2010/peas.png" /></p>
<p>Building a plug-in API is very, very hard, and having dissimilar APIs
makes it harder -- that is, if you write a plugin for Nautilus, you will
have to relearn from scratch to build a plugin for gedit. There's a
heavily duplicated code base as well, as most projects seem to have
taken the gedit plugin framework as a basis, but it's all slightly
different because of bug fixes and fitting their own special needs that
are not transmitted upstream.</p>
<p>Libpeas aims to fix all this. Plugins are good because they enable the
main codebase to remain simple and clean while allowing for lots of
additional functionality.</p>
<p>The goals are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Ease of use: the framework should be minimalist with little
boilerplate code</li>
<li>Extensible: different applications have different needs, not every
project is like gedit</li>
<li>Lightweigth: it should only load what you use, e.g. not load python
if it's not needed by any plugin</li>
</ul>
<p>Plugins can be written in C, Python, or Javascript.</p>
<p>A plugin is what you install, which can consist of one or more
extension. An extension is the implementation of an extension point
(hooks). So plugins can register extensions with several extensions
points within the application.</p>
<p>The speaker walked us through the different principles of plugins vs
extensions, and finally showed us the steps to follow to make your
applicable extensible and create hooks.</p>
<p>I can't find a page for the project on the Gnome wiki though, which is
not cool :/</p>

<div class="section" id="gnome-development-tools-high-level-debugging-and-the-misha-research-ide">
<h2>Gnome Development Tools: High-Level Debugging and the Misha Research IDE</h2>
<p>To be honest I'm not sure this was particularly Gnome-specific, although
it WAS written using Gtk tools :) <a class="reference external" href="http://fosdem.org/2010/schedule/events/gnome_devtools">Nick Papoylias introduced
us</a> to a new
genre of IDE, based on the premise that debugging hasn't really evolved
in the past 20 years when really, there are many ways it could be used
besides stepping line-by-line through a program after encountering a
problem. Debuggers can be integrated to different phases of the
development life cycle, and there are many ideas that academia has put
forward that are slow to be adopted, if at all (reverse debugging just
made it into the latest gdb for instance).</p>
<p>He admitted that they didn't respect every Gnome UI guideline but as
they were experimenting with a new approach to IDE and programming
workflow, it made sense to experiment with a different UI as well to
save space. The interface felt really busy but I'm not particularly
worried about that, that's how IDE tend to be by nature.</p>
<p>They are adding new things to rethink the debugging workflow, that work
together with the symbol debugger (gdb).</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Syntax parser: Navigate code in terms of structures, loop iteration,
functions -- not only line by line</li>
<li>Data visualisation</li>
<li>General purpose extension language: Python</li>
<li>Reverse debugging</li>
</ul>
<p>It supports stepping through the syntactic structure while having a
up-to-date data visualisation. This is a very nice way to see what is
happening as we run through the code, he showed an example of variable
insertion in a Binary Search Tree and it was amazing to see the tree be
updated for every iteration of the loop. That'd be a much faster way to
catch silly little bugs that tend to creep up as you develop (so you can
catch them even before writing lengthy unit tests).</p>
<p>The presentation ended by showing us what the extension language could
do and wow. Was that impressive. You can use Python functions to call
your C code, for both simple and elaborate calls. The Python code
directly calls C functions with no intervention from the developer. And
through the debugging console we can visualise what's going on (e.g. the
tree that is created through Python).</p>
<p>Additionally, if you create a main.py in your project, you can attach
callbacks buttons to the IDE. This is <em>really cool</em>. He had it call a
plotting application to display random results in a graph and check the
distribution or whatever. It was really impressive.</p>
<p>So Python can be used to make inter-language calls, import external
libraries, add functionality to the IDE, and call C programs directly.
