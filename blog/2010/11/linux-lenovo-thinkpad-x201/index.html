</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>As anyone who's been within hearing range can tell you, I've acquired a
new laptop recently that I've grown quite fond of. Here's my experience
getting various Linux distributions working on it, your mileage may vary
(e.g. my experience with Debian was <a class="reference external" href="http://www.nico.schottelius.org/blog/lenovo-x201-with-linux/">widely different from
others'</a>).
I ordered the laptop from the Lenovo website, the only significant specs
change was to upgrade to the i5-540M processor.</p>
<div class="section" id="ubuntu-10-10">
<h2>Ubuntu 10.10</h2>
<p>The latest version, Maverick Meerkat / 10.10 installed fine, no issues
whatsoever.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="debian-squeeze">
<h2>Debian Squeeze</h2>
<p>Debian is my main development distro and I absolutely needed it working
on the laptop before setting up everything to be Just Right<sup>TM</sup>.
Unfortunately, stable wouldn't boot, and the daily testing images were
acting very weird, asking me for a password and, no matter what I typed,
showing me an empty grub menu that slowly disappears up the screen.</p>
<p>Eventually I solved this thanks to
<a class="reference external" href="http://unetbootin.sourceforge.net">UNetbootin</a>, using it to create a
LiveUSB from Debian unstable. I'm not quite sure how it does that, but
whatever it did did the trick (yay!) and I was able to boot from the
stick and install Debian off it. If you go this way, don't forget to
update your apt sources.list to point to unstable. Also, Suspend works
for the first time ever, wahoo :D Hibernate was a bit more moody, though
it worked last time I tried it. The option seems to have disappeared
from my menus a couple of weeks back, but I've been messing with various
things including Gnome Shell, which may be related.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="fedora-13-14">
<h2>Fedora 13/14</h2>
<p>The Fedora 13 stick seemed a bit reluctant to boot up fully, but did so
after a couple of tries. The installer's partition editor wasn't playing
so nice and I ended up using GParted first to create the partition
(which led to <a class="reference external" href="https://www.jpichon.net/blog/2010/10/recovering-a-lost-partition-table/">entirely unrelated problems due to my own
clumsiness</a>).
Once this was done everything was fine, including the wireless. When I
was trying Fedora 14 prerelease in late October the stick booted fine,
and since then I've upgraded to Fedora 14 without an issue either.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="sugar-on-a-stick-mirabelle-based-on-fedora-13">
<h2>Sugar on a Stick (Mirabelle -- based on Fedora 13)</h2>
<p>The stick does not boot :/ (Black screen with the grey blinking
underscore on the top left). I must install Mango Lassi (based on Fedora
14) on a stick soon and check out if that works...</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br /></div>
</div>
<p>I still have more space than I need after installing those 3. I'll
probably try to install a source-based distro as well, either Arch or
Gentoo, not sure yet. Recommendations?</p>
