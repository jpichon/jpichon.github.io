</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>Despite finding it a bit hard to start, I tremendously enjoyed Chris
Beckett's
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Marcher-Chris-Beckett/dp/084396197X/">Marcher</a>
novel -- I would recommend not reading the extract at the beginning of
the book. The italicised prologue is a bit heavy too, but provides some
context and once you get through it the story gets interesting already,
following Charles, an immigration officer dealing with &quot;shifters&quot;,
people using a drug to move between the worlds, or more accurately
alternative timeline our world could have taken. People who have enjoyed
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.jpichon.net/blog/2010/08/a-couple-of-science-fiction-book-recs/">Beckett's short
stories</a>
will recognise the world and happily notice echoes of other stories (I'd
recommend reading <em>The Turing Test</em> first, even though you don't need
to!).</p>
<p>There's a social comment thread of the story that can't be separated
from the main plot, and sometimes doesn't feel so far from home. In this
world the poor and unemployed are confined to special &quot;inclusion zones&quot;
where they get a chance to &quot;pull themselves together&quot; and benefit from
social welfare in the meantime, and as we explore these places and meet
the social workers who work in them, we get to see the less-than-ideal
reality of this social system's implementation. The tension begins when
shifters start appearing in the inclusion zones and hiding there before
committing horrible crimes, and shifting away before facing the
consequences.</p>
<p>The book is littered with many distracting spelling mistakes, words
doubled, &quot;to&quot; instead of &quot;two&quot; and so on. Grr. Bad editing job. Besides
that annoyance, the story is fantastic, especially as it picks up when
the strange crimes start happening and we follow some events from a
shifter's point of view. I read in the bus and was starting to look
forward to traffic jams to have more time to read, and eventually had to
stay home and get to the resolution of all this! This is very
entertaining science-fiction, combined with an interesting look at
society.</p>
