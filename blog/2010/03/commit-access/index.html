</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>Through a series of kinda mind boggling coincidences, meeting people and
talking about what I have in mind and am passionate about, earlier this
month I ended up with commit access to the Pippy activity (a
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.sugarlabs.org">Sugar</a> application). Wow! Awesome. A few
weeks back, I had decided to fix as many of the broken examples as I
could after getting a bit embarrassed showing off Sugar to a teenager,
last October. He was very interested but as we were using Pippy it felt
like we were getting stack traces a bit too often (they weren't that
many really, they just happen to be more memorable.)</p>
<p>So I fixed them and the patches sat there for weeks (I didn't set the
&quot;need review&quot; flag to be fair, which I just discovered in a corner of
the wiki last week), along with a patch not-from-me in #347 which I
think should really-really make it into the next release because Pippy
is completely unusable on my (all?) netbook without it.</p>
<p>Now, I've been granted the Power Of The Commit so it should all be fine,
with me committing away and happily making the world a better place...
but it's not so simple, because really, I'm still living too far away
from the community to understand how they work and notably here, the
interactions with and within the bug tracker. For instance, I didn't
realise you were supposed to add the &quot;r?&quot; keyword when submitting a
patch, I found it accidentally when looking for something else in the
wiki. I'm not a maintainer either, so it's not entirely clear what I
should be doing with the bug report after submitting a patch or the
process to follow.</p>
<p>Although my patches are tested and too small (I believe!) to actually do
great damage, I didn't commit them... which ended up being a good idea
since one of them was incorrect :) Someone kindly commented on the bug
report saying it didn't work, with details. Turns out I was so keen on
removing the stack traces I didn't check if the error messages provided
by other Pippy examples were actually correct (so I display &quot;install
this&quot; instead of showing a stack trace, but the &quot;install this&quot; doesn't
actually solve the issue for that example, nor for the example I took it
from.) I've now attached a <a class="reference external" href="http://bugs.sugarlabs.org/ticket/638">new, better
patch</a> to the report (...and
set the proper review flag!)</p>
<p>It's probably a tad too early for me to have those commit rights, just
yet. I need a mentor still, except individually everybody is incredibly
busy being awesome already, which is fair. The truth is, I already have
a mentor if I reach out to it: the community. So this is always
something I will be working on in parallel, I really want to integrate
with the community. It just takes time for someone not so comfortable
with the &quot;public speaking effect&quot; of pouring thoughts, mistakes and
ideas on public, sometimes archived mailing lists and channels. I'll
figure it out, at my own pace. I have access to some pretty cool people
individually in the meantime if I really need help. My first area of
focus is grokking the bug tracker so I can contribute effectively there.</p>
<div class="section" id="sugar-stuff-i-want-to-figure-out">
<h2>Sugar stuff I want to figure out:</h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>How to know when a patch is big enough to warrant the &quot;r?&quot; flag, or
really should they all have it?</li>
<li>The complete process for submitting a patch. Right now, I think, a
lot of the information I am looking for is under the &quot;<a class="reference external" href="http://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Development_Team/Code_Review">Code
review</a>&quot;
wiki page which makes it not obvious to find, and it's still not a
clear step-by-step process. As I progressively get a better
understanding of how things work I'd like to improve on it and/or
eventually make a case for a &quot;Submitting patches&quot; page aimed at
brand-new contributors, ideally &quot;drive by&quot; contributors too. I'm
thinking of something along the lines of Gnome's <a class="reference external" href="http://live.gnome.org/GnomeLove/SubmittingPatches">&quot;Submitting
patches&quot; page</a>,
or Gnome's <a class="reference external" href="http://live.gnome.org/Empathy/Git">project</a>
<a class="reference external" href="http://live.gnome.org/Tomboy/HowToSubmitPatches">specific</a>
guidelines, which I found really useful when I was getting ready to
make my first open-source contribution.</li>
<li>Find out what developers do with bug reports, the best practices. How
keywords and the 5.000 status/milestones/etc fields are being used
and who gets to set them. I suspect there's probably an established
set of guidelines for Sugar core, and that activity maintainers kinda
do their own things, but still, I'm sure a set of best practices has
emerged, somehow, somewhere. Usually <a class="reference external" href="http://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/BugSquad/Triage_Guide">triaging
guides</a> are
pretty good at indicating how the <a class="reference external" href="http://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/BugSquad/Status_Fields">status
field</a> should
be used and what it means up to a certain point (usually, up to when
the developer takes charge of the bug which is when I started getting
stuck) but for Sugar, what I've seen so far doesn't seem to match the
wiki (for instance there are a lot of bug marked assigned that aren't
being worked on, and I suspect they just automatically get assigned
to the maintainer or something like this. To be investigated
further.) Also for the non-creator/non-main-maintainer of a
component, is it ok to simply close off a bug after pushing a patch,
even if no one else confirmed it worked? (I guess any problem will
bubble back up to the bug tracker anyway, eventually...)</li>
<li>Code freezes. <a class="reference external" href="http://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/0.88/Roadmap">We're in one
now</a>, but I'm not sure
how this impacts activities or if this is mostly about Sugar core,
and when/which/how a version of an activity is selected to be shipped
with the current release (and does that differ for &quot;main&quot;/fructose
activities like Pippy?)</li>
