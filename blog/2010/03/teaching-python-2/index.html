</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>I went through my 2nd Python teaching session today, with the same
students than last time. Some improvements and still, so-so-so many
things to improve. Teaching is something I really want to get better at
so I'm really motivated to debug my process.</p>
<p>Having prepared more exercises to hand out worked really well, until it
sort of backfired on me. Since we last met about 3 weeks ago, what I had
in mind was quickly recap what we did last time, then do some revisions
exercises to <em>really</em> remember what we did. My plan for the exercises
was to have several for each concept, and move on to the next concept
when everyone has completed at least one exercise. That way I had time
to walk around the class and help students having trouble, while the
more advanced students can still keep busy and learn more/get more
familiar with the concepts. This worked very well at the beginning,
until students kinda refused/didn't pay attention when I tried to move
on because the competition spirit had kicked in and most of them wanted
to finish all of the exercises (even working through break time to get
it done!).</p>
<p>So once again we only went through half of what I had prepared, except
this time it's more because of my unability to lead the class (it's also
very awesome to see students so motivated to learn to program :D) than
because I wasn't sure how much to fit in a session. I will need to
control the schedule more if I want to get to some of the REALLY cool
stuff (or at least get through all the basics!). I need to allocate more
time to introduce new concepts and introduce them better. I suspect I
kind of suck at explaining programming, and because I was looking
forward too much to helping out students individually I kinda went too
fast or just didn't try hard enough to explain in many different ways
(it's really hard to explain programming concepts. I'm much better at
helping people debug their programs, so far.)</p>
<p>3 hours is very damn long, but I don't have a lot of control over that
for this group of students. I might try 1h15 / 30 mins break / 1h15 next
time. What happened today was that after the initial burst of energy and
working through the first break, students just started losing focus,
being distracted and having a hard time getting interested. I'll have to
write lesson plans that take this into account better.</p>
<p>Or if I get better at understanding what teenagers find cool I can
sprinkle that toward the end ;) I completely underestimated how much of
a killer &quot;import random&quot; would be. Suddenly their while loop with 'if'
giving hints and 'if' limiting attempts, became a real game! (It was a
&quot;Guess the number&quot; game.) That definitely woke people up. They were
delighted to have made a small program they could actually use and play
with. I was postponing introducing &quot;random&quot; because I wasn't sure it was
a good time to introduce libraries. In the end I don't think whether it
was a library or not mattered or registered. Maybe that just goes back
to me not being great at explaining concepts, or maybe seeing really is
just a hell of a lot better than talk.</p>
<p>I'm still processing today's session, to figure out where to improve in
my preparations and the actual teaching. I think the handouts worked
well as part of the recap. As usual, tips, advice and &quot;ew can't believe
you tried to teach it this way&quot; very welcome! In the meantime, I'm
moving next week and need to learn pygame so I can teach it in two or
three weeks... :) Fun and busy!</p>
