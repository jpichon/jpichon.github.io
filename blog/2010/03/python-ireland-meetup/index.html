meet-up</a>
last night, it's the first time (at last!) that I got to hear the Python
chaps presenting, some very interesting stuff. Apparently they're doing
a &quot;return to the sources&quot; with more introductory talks, after some time
of in-depth technical talks that very few people were actually able to
get. I think it worked well.</p>
<p><img alt="Python logo" src="https://www.jpichon.net/site_media/images/python.png" /></p>
<p>The first presentation was about <strong>Jython</strong>. Until then I hadn't thought
much about it, besides &quot;yeah, Python on the JVM. Why not.&quot; Turns out
there's some really cool stuff going on there! The seamless Java &lt;-&gt;
Python integration evokes a realm of possibilities I hadn't considered
before (I thought it simply ran pure Python, I didn't know about it
talking with Java and the use of java.lang.reflect.) Jython also
integrates with a few Java containers, like JBoss and WebSphere and
that's something I definitely want to look into and see how useful it
could be in work to help script our build environment. Learning Python
version 2.1 should prove interesting...!!</p>
<p>Jython doesn't use the GIL, enabling real multi-threading. Web
frameworks can run on it too, some of them tested and confirmed like
Django. The thought of Django running on a heavy weight &quot;enterprise&quot;
Java container/server brings up a smile, for some reason. All in all a
very informative talk, that not only made me want to try out Jython but
also dig deeper into the Python language to find out more about some of
the concepts that were mentioned.</p>
<p>The second talk was a summary of some sessions from <strong>PyCon 2010</strong>,
quite interactive with the audience asking questions. Some interesting
discussions about performance, the GIL (serious case of busy wait on
multicore, fixing-in-progress), Unladden Swallow (aiming at 5x better
performance and actually getting there, huh. Cool!), an interest in
NoSQL databases (tending toward Cassandra and MongoDB rather than
CouchDB, interesting), some packaging discussions (highlighting that it
was often easier to install (using easy_install) than remove (manually
:)). There must be something to learn from the way Linux distributions
have been doing it for 15 years now. They're getting there.) Having
&quot;poster sessions&quot; for people to present a project without doing an
actual presentation is quite an interesting concept. I wonder if this
would work for other local conferences, like <a class="reference external" href="http://www.ossbarcamp.com/">OSS Bar
Camp</a>.</p>
