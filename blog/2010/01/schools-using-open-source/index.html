</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>Today I started looking around for more research on schools using or
migrating to open-source solutions and I'm finding quite an overwhelming
amount of case studies (it's great! but difficult to review and digest)
at all sorts of level (country-wide policies, city-wide, single school,
county , district, area, state...)</p>
<p>Trying to keep to the data that relates to the UK and Ireland will not
only be useful but simply make the search more manageable. It's still
great to know all this is out there and I hope I'll find a way to
benefit from it without having my head explode along the way. I think
for the stories of failures I'll keep the net wider as well, I saw very
few and there's a lot to learn from them (I found one).</p>
<p>Along the way I came across this fantastic letter from Peruvian
Congressman David Villanueva Nuñez, written in answer to a letter from
Microsoft Peru who was offended by a Bill enforcing the use of free
(libre) open-source software in government bodies, back in 2002. <a class="reference external" href="http://www.opensource.org/docs/peru_and_ms.php">The
letter is available
here</a>. I wish I could
be so eloquent, this is beautifully written and well-worth a read, the
argument is rock solid.</p>
<p>Back to the topic of open-source in schools, here's what comes out of
today's reading with regard to problems encountered.</p>
<div class="section" id="barriers-to-adoption">
<h2>Barriers to adoption</h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>(Re-)training teachers who already know Microsoft products</li>
<li>Windows-only education software that's already in use</li>
<li>&quot;Students will have to use Microsoft software at some point during
their life anyway&quot;</li>
<li>Guarantees, support</li>
</ul>
<p>The counter-points: Teachers already have to retrain and update their
course material with every upgrade of Microsoft products (that is
usually accompanied by a license cost, if not a hardware upgrade when
the OS needs to be upgraded as well).</p>
<p>Students should be taught to use software in general, not a particular
branded product. Moving from OpenOffice to Microsoft Word and vice-versa
shouldn't be difficult. Because it's in Microsoft's interest to release
new versions regularly, the interface will change anyway so being
versatile is important.</p>
<p>With regard to guarantees, I'll turn to the awesome Peruvian letter
cited above, for a description of how the guarantees of open-source
software and proprietary products are the same, if you pay attention to
the EULA of the latter. Provided &quot;AS IS.&quot; Support is necessary in both
cases as well, open-source software usually lets you pick from a wider
range of suppliers.</p>
<p>For #2 I haven't seen any specific software mentioned yet so it's hard
to explore the problem more deeply. I need more information.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="failures">
<h2>Failures</h2>
<p>In the Peruvian letter, Microsoft highlights that similar initiatives
have failed before, citing Mexico Red Escolar project. Dr Villanueva
Nuñez answers that the main issue with their approach was that they only
focused on the monetary savings and failed to account for implementation
and maintenance cost. It's very interesting in the context of the letter
because Microsoft themselves say that licence cost only accounts for 8%
of the cost of purchasing software.</p>
<p>I really want to learn more about that Red Escolar project. I think the
name has been reused for an education portal since then and it makes it
difficult to find information about that particular initiative. So far
in English I've only been able to find reports on the announcement circa
1998, 1999 but no follow-up. I probably will have to brush up on my
Spanish and go look around the source websites :)</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br /></div>
</div>
<p>I'm going to try to keep the information ordered neatly in a file or
page, in addition to this blog. This will force me to stay organised and
keep my sources straight. Today's findings started from a <a class="reference external" href="http://lwn.net/Articles/316698/">BBC article
found through LWN</a>, but I'm sure I
missed a few references along my clicking and reading of the day.
Writing this up properly as I go along will be very interesting (and
right in line with my goal of writing more!)</p>
