</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p><a class="reference external" href="http://pragprog.com/titles/prj/ship-it">Ship It!</a> is a very pleasant
read, presenting a lot of simple but powerful ideas on how to make the
software development process run more smoothly. With no unnecessary
complexity in both the writing style and the concepts being described,
it becomes easy to see how and why the ideas fit together, how they
would help improve the quality of the product and of the overall
process, and because every tool or technique remain &quot;simple&quot; many
actually feel implementable (because they are!). The book includes
strategies on how to bring about a change depending on your position
(dev, tech lead, management, customer...), and with everything neatly
cut into small parts, none is overwhelming and you can plot how best to
bring them to your shop.</p>
<p>Although it doesn't match exactly the chapter structure I'd say there
are 3 main parts to this book: tools, project management, and a list of
common problems with their solutions. Feel free to skim to that last
part when getting the book if you feel the need for a little bit of hope
but I would advise reading the book in order, because many of the
suggested solutions won't make a lot of sense otherwise.</p>
<p>Overall excellent, the writing style makes this book a pleasure to read
and doesn't distract from the content. I came away with a ton of ideas
on how to improve things and remove some of the difficulties of the
software development process that really don't belong, and I hope to be
able to demonstrate some of them to my team soon.</p>
