HackFest</a>.</p>

<div class="section" id="first-day-first-impressions">
<h2>First day, first impressions</h2>
<p>I was about 6 hours late for the first day, mostly due to weather
related delays at Dublin Airport. I would have been a little late anyway
(not enough days off left to fly in on Wednesday), but once there I
quickly realised how beneficial it would have been to arrive a day
early, attend the Welcome Dinner, and get to know people (at least
names!) before trying to work with them. Lesson learnt for next time.</p>
<p>The first day was mostly discussions and planning what should be done,
and toward the end assigning tasks to people for the following days. The
whole HackFest thing is very focused, that first day was a lot of nerdy
discussions except with a focus on getting things done (and thus not
much patience for staying off topic). People were also careful not to
make decisions for the whole community.</p>
<p>During most discussions, a few people were dominating/leading the
conversation, which I wondered a little about at times. Some voices
sometimes got ignored because someone louder started speaking or
answering a question over them.</p>
<p>Being late meant that when a couple of topics I have an interest in came
up, I didn't have yet a good enough grasp of the group dynamics to be
able to chime in (my fault for being late and not speaking up anyhow).
For instance someone mentioned the idea of a &quot;Kid's corner&quot; in the
documentation for school students to learn about Gnome development.
That's a <a class="reference external" href="https://www.jpichon.net/blog/2010/04/teaching-how-program-using-python-roundup/">topic dear to my
heart</a>,
and what an awesome idea! There was no time to work on it during the
HackFest but in case the idea surfaces up again I hope I will be around
to listen in and participate.</p>
<p>In the end, the main plan became to work on a catalogue of &quot;cool&quot; demos
to show and teach about different aspects of the platform -- first
applications at a level a little bit above &quot;Hello, World&quot;, for
developers to try and expand on with their own cool ideas (the licence
for the code in the documentation will allow for this, of course). Some
people worked on
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.0d.be/2010/12/04/dev-doc-tools-hackfest/">other</a>
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.andreasn.se/blog/?p=159">cool</a> stuff.</p>

<div class="section" id="the-hackfest-continues">
<h2>The HackFest continues</h2>
<p>I kinda messed up day #2. I can't help with writing code examples
because I wouldn't know how to do most of them yet, and I haven't
internalised best practices in Gnome Development either. So I kinda hid
instead (I still had a good time! But I felt bad for not contributing
enough).</p>
<p>I could have helped with writing, but it turns out most people wrote at
fine to awesome levels all on their own already :) That left me with
trying out tutorials and reviewing them with the fresh shiny eyes of a
newcomer to the platform, which required the tutorials to be written
first.</p>
<p>From day #3 I started jumping on people as they entered the office and
constantly asking &quot;Do you have anything you'd like me to look at?&quot; so
people knew to send things my way. Turns out some libraries (like libgda
or webkit) couldn't build this week due to changes in gtk3 and I ended
the day with Gnome Shell not starting on my machine, GStreamer behaving
in the strangest way and also a better knowledge of Jhbuild (&quot;Erm, could
someone with a few minutes help me understand a Jhbuild issue?&quot; - &quot;
*laugh* You do realise the maintainer is sitting besides you,
right?&quot;). Things merrily continued till the end of the last day, and I
managed to test and review several tutorials and increase my knowledge
of GStreamer, Javascript-the-Gnome-way, Clutter and Gtk, as well as
learn about <a class="reference external" href="http://projectmallard.org">Mallard</a> (the real question
being, MAllard or mallARD?), glühwein, and how to say croissant in
German (that's &quot;croissant&quot;).</p>
<p>Sometimes someone would bring up a topic of conversation (intro to
Mallard, what to include in the platform overview, how to revamp
developer.gnome.org, ...) and people would assemble around the table,
maybe use the projector and discuss what direction to take.</p>
<p>People did a beautiful job with the demo examples I got to test. They
are simple, well explained, quick to try out and you do learn a lot when
you go through them, while usually still getting a hint that there is
more awesomeness to find if you dig further into Gnome. Most of the
problems I encountered won't be problems when people run the examples on
a stable Gnome 3 system in the future, as opposed to an active/fluid
development version within a sandbox. I kinda failed at being a good
representative of Python-as-a-first-class-citizen though: no example was
completed in the Python language over the 4 days! C, Vala and Javascript
will be nicely represented though.</p>
<p>People are very much &quot;Work hard, Play hard&quot; in a hackfest environment.
Thanks to our <a class="reference external" href="http://www.openismus.com">Openismus</a> hosts we got to
work in a nice office, be introduced to lovely restaurants and visit a
Christmas market among other things. People would go out at night and
then come back to the office around 10 or 11pm and work longer into the
night. I never stayed that late (happier working in the morning, as
strange as it may be for a hacker).</p>
<p>As with my GUADEC experience, the Gnome folks are an incredibly nice
bunch, very welcoming. An interested newcomer dropped by unannounced on
Sunday and was taken under someone's wing to work on documentation
tasks, mentor within arm reach.</p>
<p>I suspect it might have been a tad too early for me to attend a hackfest
though (considering my lack of experience with the community and in
general), even though I came here as one of the <a class="reference external" href="http://people.gnome.org/%7Eshaunm/Hackfest.html">main targets for this
documentation
effort</a> -- the
Hobbyist, happy Gnome user and eager wannabe contributor. I'm still glad
I attended and jätte-happy with my experience, and I hope my comments
and feedback on the examples were helpful. Perhaps that is something I
can keep helping with.</p>
