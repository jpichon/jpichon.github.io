</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>It's the first Malcolm Gladwell book I read and I'm well impressed. It's
a pleasant read that challenges various preconceptions. It does seem
heavily based on anecdotes but I think the people used as examples
illustrate the points made well enough. The overall style of the book
often reminded me of &quot;Freakonomics&quot; -- if you didn't like the style you
probably won't like this one either.</p>
<p>The thesis of the book is that there is more than &quot;hard work&quot; and/or
&quot;being smart&quot; to becoming an outlier in any field. People who make it
big were also given incredible opportunities to learn and put in their
10,000 hours of training before they could shine. They worked hard for
sure, but most of the time when and where you're born matters just as
much. &quot;Genius&quot; and mastery aren't necessarily innate and don't matter as
much as many people like to think either.</p>
<p>The second section of the book talks about cultural legacies and is
fairly interesting as well, showing the impact on domains ranging from
plane crashes to maths &amp; reading ability to local feuds. As someone
who's been living in a fairly different culture than my home country's
for a few years now, I enjoyed reading chapters that clarified some of
the things I've experienced but could not explain (like the effect of
the &quot;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.clearlycultural.com/geert-hofstede-cultural-dimensions/power-distance-index/">power distance
index</a>&quot;
on human interactions).</p>
<p>It's a light read that I have no problems recommending. I'm going to get
&quot;Blink&quot; from the same author next.</p>
