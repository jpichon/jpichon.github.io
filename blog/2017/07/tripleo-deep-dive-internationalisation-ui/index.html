</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>Yesterday, as part of the <a class="reference external" href="https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/tripleo-deep-dive-topics">TripleO Deep
Dives</a>
series I gave a short introduction to internationalisation in <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/openstack/tripleo-ui">TripleO
UI</a>: the technical aspects
of it, as well as a quick overview of how we work with the I18n team.</p>
<p>You can catch the recording on
<a class="reference external" href="https://bluejeans.com/s/XmuHa">BlueJeans</a> or
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmAw7b2yUEo">YouTube</a>, and below's a
transcript.</p>
<p>~</p>
<div class="section" id="life-and-journey-of-a-string">
<h2>Life and Journey of a String</h2>
<p>Internationalisation was added to the UI during Ocata - just a release
ago. <a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/florianfuchs">Florian</a> implemented most of
it and did the lion's share of the work, as can be seen <a class="reference external" href="https://blueprints.launchpad.net/tripleo/+spec/tripleo-ui-i18n-support-for-js">on the
blueprint</a>
if you're curious about the nitty-gritty details.</p>
<div class="section" id="addition-to-the-codebase">
<h3>Addition to the codebase</h3>
<p>Here's <a class="reference external" href="https://review.openstack.org/#/c/416564/3/src/js/components/plan/NewPlan.js">an example
patch</a>
from during the transition. On the left you can see how things were
hard-coded, and on the right you can see the new defineMessages()
interface we now use. Obviously new patches should directly look like on
the right hand-side nowadays.</p>
<p>The defineMessages() dictionary requires a unique id and default English
string for every message. Optionally, you can also provide a description
if you think there could be confusion or to clarify the meaning. The
description will be shown in Zanata to the translators - remember they
see no other context, only the string itself.</p>
<p>For example, <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/openstack/tripleo-ui/blob/68e868/src/js/components/plan/PlanFormTabs.js#L29-L33">a string might sound active like if it were related to an
action/button but actually be a descriptive help
string</a>.
Or some expressions are known to be confusing in English - &quot;provide a
node&quot; has been the source of multiple <a class="reference external" href="http://lists.openstack.org/pipermail/openstack-dev/2016-July/098746.html">discussions on
list</a>
and live so might as well pre-empt questions and <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/openstack/tripleo-ui/blob/68e868/src/js/components/nodes/NodesTableView.js#L31-L36">offer additional
context to help the translators decide on an appropriate
translation</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="extraction-conversion">
<h3>Extraction &amp; conversion</h3>
<p>Now we know how to add an internationalised string to the codebase - how
do these get extracted into a file that will be uploaded to Zanata?</p>
<p>All of the following steps are described in the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/openstack/tripleo-ui/blob/68e868/docs/translation.rst">translation
documentation</a>
in the tripleo-ui repository. Assuming you've already run the
installation steps (basically, <em>npm install</em>):</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
$ npm run build
</pre>
<p>This does a lot more than just extracting strings - it prepares the code
for being deployed in production. Once this ends you'll be able to find
your newly extracted messages under the <em>i18n</em> directory:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
$ ls i18n/extracted-messages/src/js/components
</pre>
<p>You can see the directory structure is kept the same as the source code.
And if you peek into one of the files, you'll note the content is
basically the same as what we had in our defineMessages() dictionary:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
$ cat i18n/extracted-messages/src/js/components/Login.json
[
  {
    &quot;id&quot;: &quot;UserAuthenticator.authenticating&quot;,
    &quot;defaultMessage&quot;: &quot;Authenticating...&quot;
  },
  {
    &quot;id&quot;: &quot;Login.username&quot;,
    &quot;defaultMessage&quot;: &quot;Username&quot;
  },
  {
    &quot;id&quot;: &quot;Login.usernameRequired&quot;,
    &quot;defaultMessage&quot;: &quot;Username is required.&quot;
  },
[...]
</pre>
<p>However, JSON is not a format that Zanata understands by default. I
think the latest version we upgraded to, or the next one might have some
support for it, but since there's no i18n JSON standard it's somewhat
limited. In open-source software projects, po/pot files are generally
the standard to go with.</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
$ npm run json2pot

<div class="section" id="infra-from-the-git-repo-to-zanata">
<h3>Infra: from the git repo, to Zanata</h3>
<p>The following steps are done by the infrastructure scripts. There's
<a class="reference external" href="https://docs.openstack.org/infra/manual/creators.html#enabling-translation-infrastructure">infra documentation on how to enable translations for your
project</a>,
in our case as the first internationalised JavaScript project we had to
update the scripts a little as well. This is useful to know if an issue
happens with the infra jobs; debugging will probably bring you here.</p>
<p>The scripts live in the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/openstack-infra/project-config/tree/605299/jenkins/scripts">project-config infra
repo</a>
and there are three files of interest for us:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/openstack-infra/project-config/blob/605299/jenkins/scripts/common_translation_update.sh">common_translation_update.sh</a>
- a bunch of common functions</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/openstack-infra/project-config/blob/605299/jenkins/scripts/propose_translation_update.sh#L241">propose_translation_update.sh</a>
- proposes the translations back to the repository (we'll talk about
it in a bit)</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/openstack-infra/project-config/blob/605299/jenkins/scripts/upstream_translation_update.sh#L75">upstream_translation_update.sh</a>
- that sends the translations up to Zanata</li>
</ul>
<p>In this case, upstream_translation_update.sh is the file of interest
to us: it simply <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/openstack-infra/project-config/blob/master/jenkins/scripts/upstream_translation_update.sh#L75-L79">sets up the project on line
76</a>,
then <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/openstack-infra/project-config/blob/605299/jenkins/scripts/upstream_translation_update.sh#L115">sends the pot file up to Zanata on line
115</a>.</p>
<p>What does &quot;setting up the project&quot; entails? It's a function in
common_translations_update.sh, that pretty much <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/openstack-infra/project-config/blob/605299/jenkins/scripts/common_translation_update.sh#L252-L271">runs the steps we
talked about in the previous section, and also creates a config file to
talk to
Zanata</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="monitoring-the-post-jobs">
<h3>Monitoring the post jobs</h3>
<p>Post jobs run after a patch has already merged - usually to upload
tarballs where they should be, update the documentation pages, etc, and
also upload messages catalogues onto Zanata. Being a 'post' job however
means that if something goes wrong, there is no notification on the
original review so it's easy to miss.</p>
<p>Here's the <a class="reference external" href="http://status.openstack.org/openstack-health/#/g/build_queue/post?groupKey=build_queue&amp;searchJob=tripleo-ui">OpenStack Health page to monitor 'post' jobs related to
tripleo-ui</a>.
Scroll to the bottom - hopefully tripleo-ui-upstream-translation-update
is still green! It's good to keep an eye on it although it's easy to
forget. Thankfully, AJaeger from #openstack-infra has been great at
filing bugs and letting us know when <a class="reference external" href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/tripleo/+bug/1691006">something does go
wrong</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="debugging-when-things-go-wrong-an-example">
<h3>Debugging when things go wrong: an example</h3>
<p>We had a couple of issues whereby a <a class="reference external" href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/tripleo/+bug/1674011">linebreak gets
introduced</a> into one
of the strings, which works fine in JSON but breaks our pot file. If you
look at the content from the bug (the full logs are no longer
accessible):</p>
<pre class="literal-block">

<p>You'll notice the first line is <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/openstack-infra/project-config/blob/605299/jenkins/scripts/upstream_translation_update.sh#L115">the last function we call in the
upstream_translation_update.sh

for debugging that gives you an idea of the steps to follow to
reproduce. The <a class="reference external" href="https://translate.zanata.org">upstream Zanata
instance</a> also lets you create toy
projects, if you want to test uploads yourself (this can't be done
directly on the OpenStack Zanata instance.)</p>
<p>This particular newline issue has popped up a couple of times already.
We're treating it with band-aids at the moment, ideally we'd get a
proper test on the gate to prevent it from happening again: this is why
<a class="reference external" href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/tripleo/+bug/1674011">this bug is still
open</a>. I'm not very
familiar with JavaScript testing and haven't had a chance to look into
it yet; if you'd like to give it a shot that'd be a useful contribution
:)</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="zanata-and-contributing-translations">
<h3>Zanata, and contributing translations</h3>
<p>The OpenStack Zanata instance lives at <a class="reference external" href="https://translate.openstack.org">https://translate.openstack.org</a>.
This is where the translators do their work. <a class="reference external" href="https://translate.openstack.org/project/view/tripleo-ui">Here's the page for
tripleo-ui</a>,
you can see there is one project per branch (stable/ocata and master,
for now). Sort by &quot;Percent Translated&quot; to see the languages currently
translated. Here's an example of the <a class="reference external" href="https://translate.openstack.org/webtrans/translate?project=tripleo-ui&amp;iteration=stable-ocata&amp;localeId=es&amp;locale=en-US&amp;dswid=-8746#view:doc;doc:i18n/messages">translator's view, for
Spanish</a>:
you can see the English string on the left, and the translator fills in
the right side. No context! Just strings.</p>
<p>At this stage of the release cycle, the focus would be on 'master,'
although it is still early to do translations; there is a lot of churn
still.</p>
<p>If you'd like to contribute translations, the <a class="reference external" href="https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/I18n">I18n
team</a> has <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.openstack.org/i18n/latest/">good
documentation</a> about <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.openstack.org/i18n/latest/official_translator.html">how to
go about how to do
it</a>.
The short version: sign up on Zanata, request to join your language
team, once you're approved - you're good to go!</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="return-of-the-string">
<h3>Return of the string</h3>
<p>Now that we have our strings available in multiple languages, it's time
for another infra job to kick in and bring them into our repository.
This is where
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/openstack-infra/project-config/blob/605299/jenkins/scripts/propose_translation_update.sh#L241-L257">propose_translation_update.sh</a>
comes in. We pull the po files from Zanata, convert them to JSON, then
do a git commit that will be proposed to Gerrit.</p>
<p>The <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/openstack-infra/project-config/blob/605299/jenkins/scripts/propose_translation_update.sh#L245">cleanup
step</a>
does more than it might seem. It checks if files are translated over a
certain ratio (~75% for code), which avoids adding new languages when
there might only be one or two words translated (e.g. someone just
testing Zanata to see how it works). Switching to your language and yet
having the vast majority of the UI still appear in English is not a
great user experience.</p>
<p>In theory, files that were added but are now below 40% should get
automatically removed, however this <a class="reference external" href="https://storyboard.openstack.org/#!/story/2000949">doesn't quite work for
JavaScript</a> at the
moment - another opportunity to help! Manual cleanups can be done in the
meantime, but it's a rare event so not a major issue.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="monitoring-the-periodic-jobs">
<h3>Monitoring the periodic jobs</h3>
<p>Zanata is checked once a day every morning, there is an <a class="reference external" href="http://status.openstack.org/openstack-health/#/g/build_queue/periodic?groupKey=build_queue&amp;searchJob=tripleo-ui">OpenStack
Health
page</a>
for this as well. You can see there are two jobs at the moment
(hopefully green!), one per branch:
tripleo-ui-propose-translation-update and
tripleo-ui-propose-translation-update-ocata. The job should run every
day even if there are no updates - it simply means there might not be a
git review proposed at the end.</p>
<p>We haven't had issues with the periodic job so far, though the debugging
process would be the same: figure out based on the failure if it is
happening at the infra script stage or in one of our commands (e.g. <em>npm
run po2json</em>), try to reproduce and fix. I'm sure super-helpful AJaeger
would also let us know if he were to notice an issue here.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="automated-patches">
<h3>Automated patches</h3>
<p>You may have seen the <a class="reference external" href="https://review.openstack.org/#/q/project:openstack/tripleo-ui+topic:zanata/translations">automated translations
updates</a>
pop up on Gerrit. The commit message has some <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.openstack.org/i18n/latest/reviewing-translation-import.html">tips on how to
review</a>
these: basically don't agonise over the translation contents as problems
there should be handled in Zanata anyway, just make sure the format
looks good and is unlikely to break the code. A <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/openstack-infra/project-config/blob/605299/jenkins/scripts/propose_translation_update.sh#L251">JSON validation
tool</a>
runs during the infra prep step in order to &quot;prettify&quot; the JSON blob and
limit the size of the diffs, therefore once the patch&nbsp; makes it out to
Gerrit we know the JSON is well-formed at least.</p>
<p>Try to review these patches quickly to respect the translators' work.
Not very nice to spend a lot of time on translating a project and yet
not have your work included because no one was bothered to merge it :)</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="a-note-about-new-languages">
<h3>A note about new languages...</h3>
<p>If the automated patch adds a new language, there'll be an <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/openstack/tripleo-ui/blob/68e8684162811c88fb10c8c43c8e59bec3510eb2/docs/translation.rst#adding-a-new-language">additional
step
required</a>
after merging the translations in order to enable it: adding a string
with the language name to a constants file. Until recently, this took 3
or 4 steps - <a class="reference external" href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/tripleo/+bug/1682452">thanks to Honza for making it much
simpler</a>!</p>
<p>This concludes the technical journey of a string. If you'd like to help
with i18n tasks, we have <a class="reference external" href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/tripleo/+bugs?field.tag=i18n">a few related
bugs</a> open.
They go from very simple low-hanging-fruits you could use to make your
first contribution to the UI, to weird buttons that have translations
available yet show in English but only in certain modals, to the kind of
CI resiliency tasks I linked to earlier. Something for everyone! ;)</p>

<h2>Working with the I18n team</h2>
<p>It's really all about communication. Starting with...</p>
<div class="section" id="release-schedule-and-string-freezes">
<h3>Release schedule and string freezes</h3>
<p>String freezes are noted on the <a class="reference external" href="https://releases.openstack.org/pike/schedule.html">main
schedule</a> but tend
to fit the regular cycle-with-milestones work. This is a problem for a
cycle-trailing project like tripleo-ui as we could be implementing
features up to 2 weeks after the other projects, so we can't freeze
strings that early.</p>
<p>There were discussions at the Atlanta PTG around whether the I18n should
care at all about projects that don't respect the freeze deadlines. That
would have made it impossible for projects like ours to ever make it
onto the I18n official radar. The compromise was that cycle-trailing
project should have a <a class="reference external" href="https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/CrossProjectLiaisons#I18n">I18n cross-project
liaison</a>
that communicates with the I18n PTL and team to inform them of
deadlines, and also to ignore Soft Freeze and only do a Hard Freeze.</p>
<p>This will all be documented under an i18n governance tag; while waiting
for it the <a class="reference external" href="https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/i18n-horizon-release-collaboration-session">notes from the sessions are
available</a>
for the curious!</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-s-a-string-freeze-again">
<h3>What's a String Freeze again?</h3>
<p>The two are defined on the schedule: <a class="reference external" href="https://releases.openstack.org/pike/schedule.html#p-soft-sf">soft
freeze</a>
means not allowing changes to strings, as it invalidates the
translator's work and forces them to retranslate; <a class="reference external" href="https://releases.openstack.org/pike/schedule.html#p-hard-sf">hard
freeze</a>
means no additions, changes or anything else in order to give
translators a chance to catch up.</p>
<p>When we looked at Zanata earlier, there were <a class="reference external" href="https://translate.openstack.org/iteration/view/tripleo-ui/master">translation percentages
beside each
language</a>:
the goal is always the satisfaction of reaching 100%. If we keep adding
new strings then the goalpost keeps moving, which is discouraging and
unfair.</p>
<p>Of course there's also an &quot;exception process&quot; when needed, to ask for
permission to merge a string change with an explanation or at least a
heads-up, by sending an email to the <a class="reference external" href="http://lists.openstack.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/openstack-i18n">openstack-i18n mailing
list</a>.
Not to be abused :)</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="role-of-the-i18n-liaison">
<h3>Role of the I18n liaison</h3>
<p>...Liaise?! Haha. The role is defined briefly on the <a class="reference external" href="https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/CrossProjectLiaisons#I18n">Cross-Projects
Liaison wiki
page</a>.
It's much more important toward the end of the cycle, when the codebase
starts to stabilise, there are fewer changes and translators look at
starting their work to be included in the release.</p>
<p>In general it's good to hang out on the #openstack-i18n IRC channel
(very low traffic), <a class="reference external" href="https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Meetings/I18nTeamMeeting">attend the weekly
meeting</a>
(it alternates times), be available to answer questions, and keep the
PTL informed of the I18n status of the project. In the case of
cycle-trailing projects (quite a new release model still), it's also
important to be around to explain the deadlines.</p>
<p>A couple of examples having an active liaison helps with:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Toward the end or after the release, once translations into the
stable branch have settled, the stable translations get copied into
the master branch on Zanata. The strings should still be fairly
similar at that point and it avoids translators having to re-do the
work. It's a manual process, so you need to let the I18n PTL know
when there are no longer changes to stable/*.</li>
<li>Last cycle, because the cycle-trailing status of tripleo-ui was not
correctly documented, a Zanata upgrade was planned right after the
main release - which for us ended up being right when the codebase
had stabilised enough and several translators had planned to be most
active. Would have been solved with better, earlier communication :)</li>

<h3>Post-release</h3>
<p>After the Ocata release, I sent <a class="reference external" href="http://imgur.com/a/tlnAx">a few
screenshots</a> of tripleo-ui to the i18n list
so translators could see the result of their work. I don't know if
anybody cared :-) But unlike Horizon, which has an informal test system
available for translators to check their strings during the RC period,
most of the people who volunteered translations had no idea what the UI
looked like. It'd be cool if we could offer a test system with regular
string updates next release - maybe just an undercloud on the new RDO
cloud? Deployment success/failures strings wouldn't be verifiable but
the rest would, while the system would be easier to maintain than a full
dev TripleO environment - better than nothing. Perhaps an idea for the
Queens cycle!</p>
<p>The I18n team has a <a class="reference external" href="https://translate.openstack.org/">priority board on the Zanata main
page</a> (only visible when logged in
I think). I'm grateful to see TripleO UI in there! :) Realistically
we'll never move past Low or perhaps Medium priority which is fair, as
TripleO doesn't have the same kind of reach or visibility that Horizon
or the installation guides do. I'm happy that we're included! The
OpenStack I18n team is probably the most volunteer-driven team in
OpenStack. Let's be kind, respect string freezes and translators' time!
