</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>I wanted to take a few minutes to give a shout out to <a class="reference external" href="http://www.e-guesthouse.com/eng/sapporo/">DK House in
Sapporo</a>, as a great option
to get affordable housing for mediumish to longer stays in Japan. I
spent a month there in September.</p>
<p><img alt="DK house front" src="https://www.jpichon.net/site_media/images/2014/dk_house.jpg" /></p>
<p>They specialise in short-term accommodations, normally starting from 3
months but if you want to stay for a shorter time like I did, you can
get in touch with them in advance and ask if it's ok. Despite sending my
queries in both Japanese and English, they replied in English only so
you don't need to be overly concerned about the language if your
Japanese isn't up to snuff yet :-)</p>
<p>The facilities are clean and the staff is always really helpful. As I
was staying only a few weeks I couldn't get a room with a private
bathroom, but it didn't turn out to be a problem. I never had to queue
for a shower. There's also a shared kitchen and a convenient laundry
room.</p>
<p>The rooms have a desk and a LAN port and I didn't have any major issues
with the Internet. As a backup I'd rented a &quot;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.globaladvancedcomm.com/pocketwifi.html">pocket
wifi</a>&quot; and I was
glad to have it for network-intensive operations (ahem, devstack) or
when there was a bit too much contention. Also, there is no wireless in
the rooms. (If you're planning to spend a lot of time at that desk, you
may want to mentally prepare yourself for the fact that the chair was
not picked for its ergonomic qualities!).</p>
<p>There's some totally optional activities from time to time in the common
room, if you want to meet with the other residents. You're a few minutes
away from the tramway (市電) which leads you straight to the city centre
in 15 minutes, 3 konbinis (Lawson, Seven Eleven) and a super tasty ramen
place (てつや - I recommend the しょうゆ).</p>
<p>Now if you're used to luxurious super comfortable hotel mattresses and
spacious rooms I suppose you may be disappointed.</p>

<p>Personally I'm really happy with my experience and heartily recommend
the place :)</p>
