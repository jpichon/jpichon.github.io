</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>Last week I participated in a 3 day-long &quot;<a class="reference external" href="http://hiberniantrainingcourses.ie/index.php/courses/train-the-trainer">Train the
Trainer</a>&quot;
course at <a class="reference external" href="http://hiberniantrainingcourses.ie/">Hibernian College</a> in
Dublin. My goals were to get a better understanding of how to teach to
adults and learn how to design and deliver effective training sessions,
in order to improve my technical courses and workshops, and teach
better. It's something I had wanted to do for a couple of years and I'm
glad I finally jumped and did it! I found the course both very enjoyable
and very useful.</p>
<div class="section" id="choosing-the-course">
<h2>Choosing the course</h2>
<p>Originally I was waiting for <a class="reference external" href="http://www.engineersireland.ie">Engineers
Ireland</a> to put their 5-day &quot;Train
the Trainer&quot; course back on their CPD calendar but after contacting
them, it turns out they are not planning on running it again in the
short term.</p>
<p>Trawling the interwebs, there are a lot of training providers out there
and it can be difficult to figure out which ones are legit (perhaps I
was lucky!). I decided to go with a FETAC approved course even though I
don't truly need the certification at this stage, because I figured if a
course is approved to offer a government backed certification it'll be
somewhat serious. After that, it was down to the luck of SEO and how
helpful people were when I requested information. The Hibernian folks
answered all my questions promptly and are lovely to deal with, both by
email and face-to-face.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-course">
<h2>The course</h2>
<p>The advantage of a 3-day course is that you don't need to take so much
time off work. The disadvantage is that it is pretty intense! I would
recommend having a couple of hours available in the evening for
homework, particularly on day 2. The course I did was instructed by
Maura O'Toole, who also happens to have some background in computing
from early in her career which made for a few funny stories. Otherwise
as a professional trainer with a couple decades of experience, she had a
lot of anecdotes to illustrate her content and advice and make them
memorable. I also liked that although we did go through all the FETAC
material, she made sure to contrast it with how the real world works
whenever relevant, based on her own knowledge and experience.</p>
<p>It must be a somewhat stressful course to teach because as you explain
how to do things, people are analysing what you're doing and checking
how it matches against what you are saying - and will call you out on
any discrepancy!</p>
<p>The first day is the most intense, I think, which is probably just as
well since people come in full of energy and expectations. I learnt a
ton right from the icebreaker and icebreaker analysis - not only about
training in general but also things I specifically want to try in my
next course. That got me enthused for the day! By day 3 it was more
difficult to keep the energy levels very high, despite the interest
still being there.</p>
<p>The class size is kept small, which is actually a FETAC requirement (max
8 people) and makes for a nice environment, particularly as people need
to get up and present quite regularly. The participants' backgrounds
were quite varied and we all heard presentations about horticulture,
clinical trials, powerboat exams, TV production, programming...</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="assessment">
<h2>Assessment</h2>
<p>The assessment is in two parts: a &quot;skills demonstration&quot; video where you
spend 10 minutes - <em>exactly</em> 10 minutes - showing off your mad
training/presentation skills, and a ~2600 words written assignment
showing how you would prepare, design and deliver (or have already) a
particular training session, to return within 4 weeks of completing the
course. You need a pass mark (40%) in each component to get the
certificate.</p>
<p>The requirements for the video are such that it contradicts a lot of
what is learnt during the course. You shouldn't really be interacting
with your students on the video (it's about showing <em>your</em> skills) - and
it would probably be quite fake anyway. It's important to stick closely
to the time. It was strange to pretend to teach programming with slides.</p>
<p>I still did my best though, I couldn't help wanting to try and plant the
idea of maybe learning programming, in the head of my fellow trainees
:-) They kindly indulged me. No one was particularly fond of the camera
and the atmosphere was really supportive during the day, no matter the
number of retakes.</p>
<p>According to the instructor, we all passed the skills demonstration
(yay!), although the videos still need to go to the external FETAC
examiner to confirm the final grades.</p>
<p>It was strange for me to go from nothing to doing a graded presentation
on camera within 3 days. I'm used to preparing and rehearsing and
rererererehearsing a lot more than that. It's probably good to just get
it out of the way quickly, though perfectionists who want to shoot for
the highest grades (ahem) will find it weird. I thought it was good.</p>
<p>Material-wise I was able to reuse content from my previous courses so
that was one less concern in terms of preparation, I only had to adapt a
little. People who never taught or trained before maybe have a bit of a
rougher time (then again if they're deeply knowledgeable on a topic,
maybe not). Likewise if you're not comfortable with public speaking (as
in, at the level of standing up and introducing yourself/talking shite
with a handful of supportive people in the room, without having a panic
attack) I would carefully consider whether to attend such a fast-paced
course.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="a-few-things-i-learnt">
<h2>A few things I learnt</h2>
<p>It's comforting when best practices are described and this happens to
match how I've been doing things :-) (For instance my way of doing
training evaluation is probably not too crap).</p>
<p>It dawned on me at some point during day 2 that what I was trying to fix
- the ways my sessions are designed - is not my main problem. My main
issue is that the objectives for my courses are not defined clearly - I
kinda try to fit as much as I can without overwhelming within the time I
have available. Working from the results I want (using the useful
&quot;Training Analysis Framework&quot; I now possess!) would allow me to clarify
exactly what I want to achieve, which will then help me organise and
(re)arrange my sessions as needed, rather than follow the chronological
order. As a very important bonus point, it will help me write course
descriptions that are more specific and should help &quot;weed out&quot; the
people that the course is not designed for (i.e. non-beginners). I am
really happy about this, this is a big problem each time.</p>
<p>I also learnt what I thought was my &quot;happy smiley presentation face&quot; is
actually &quot;my serious face.&quot; Must calibrate better! :-)</p>
<p>There'll be a lot more once I got through my notes again, but the fact
that I was trying to fix the wrong thing was a huge revelation and I'm
really happy I figured this out. Sadly I got sick right after the course
(better than being sick for the filming, I guess!) and I haven't had a
chance to sort out the rest of my notes - or, er, start on the
assignment.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="next">
<h2>Next</h2>
<p>I have a couple of weeks to complete the assessment. Hopefully I can get
a big chunk of it done over the week-end, once the cold is gone. From
what I understand, it is quite time-consuming and the instructor
suggested doing it for a course we're actually planning on teaching so
that the output is useful and usable, rather than a simple academic
exercise. I plan to use my intro to programming course for this, except
on a different timeline (I'll imagine it's taught over a couple of days
rather than in the evening - and who knows, if I'm inspired I might just
go and try teaching it in that format too!)</p>
<p>After that, I want to schedule the course and teach again in
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.tog.ie/">Tog</a>. I &quot;paused&quot; teaching because I felt my
course wasn't good enough and I wanted to overhaul it first. As with
many &quot;let's redo it from scratch!&quot; projects, it's just meant I haven't
taught in over a year now... So, time to fix this, and as I
refamiliarise myself with the course first time around, the only major
change I'll make will be to update the examples to Python 3. It's time!</p>
<p><em>Updated in May to add: I passed! :) Let's go and teach all the things!</em></p>
