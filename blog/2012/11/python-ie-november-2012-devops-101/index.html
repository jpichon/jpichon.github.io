</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>Shame on me for not blogging about <a class="reference external" href="http://python.ie/pycon/2012/">PyCon
Ireland</a> this year, another success
where I happily spent a big chunk of time greeting attendees at the
registration desk and attended some interesting talks.</p>
<p>The stylish volunteers:</p>
<p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="https://www.jpichon.net/site_media/images/2012/Python-Ireland-Volunteers.jpg"><img alt="PyCon Ireland 2012 Volunteers" src="https://www.jpichon.net/site_media/images/2012/Python-Ireland-Volunteers.thumb.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>In the meantime, I took better notes at the November Python Ireland
meet-up, where <a class="reference external" href="http://spamt.net">Ulrich</a> took us through DevOps 101,
going from the basics of what it is and all sort of related tools to
help, mostly Python-based.</p>
<p>I thought interesting that Ulrich worked from a specific definition of
DevOps that differs from the ones I heard. There was a time when I used
to call myself &quot;a devop&quot; because in addition to development work I was
also maintaining production and test servers and handling deployments,
etc. However at the time I learnt from other sources that &quot;a devop&quot; was
actually a system admin who also writes code to make their job easier...
so I just stopped using the word ;) Ulrich based his talk on the
premise&nbsp; of development and operations working together.</p>
<p>Development tends to move fast while operations are more stable and
conservative, why would you put these groups together?</p>
<p>The need to scale is an important one. You need the knowledge that the
developers have of the application itself, but you also need to
understand infrastructure. For instance if you deploy something and
suddenly the number of requests spikes, you want devs and ops to be
close together to solve the problem.</p>
<p>Following a &quot;release early, release often&quot; principle where you might
deploy several times a day makes that collaboration important.</p>
<p>Environments are complicated and it's important for people to integrate
; if the departments remain separate people tend to stick only with the
same group of people.</p>
<p>Devops enable better communication and understanding. Developers can
move fast and deploy faster as they know what ops need. This also helps
mitigate risk thanks to the regular deployments: fewer changes are
deployed at once (helpful to determine what breaks) and it becomes
easier to do.</p>
<p>The talk then moved on to tools, including advice on how to create a
simple django app to keep track of which versions of software are
deployed where -- very simple and yet usually enough.</p>
<p>Some of the projects that were mentioned:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Using <a class="reference external" href="http://swordapp.org">Sword</a> instead of puppet (...which is
still best, apparently) if you want to stick to Python, though it's a
very young project. Using such tools you can start versioning your
configuration and environment, and store reasons for changes in
commit messages.</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://fabfile.org">Fabric</a> for ssh the Python way :)</li>
<li>Virtualenv to isolate Python and manage dependencies</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://www.buildout.org/">Buildout</a> is like Maven for Python
projects. It's used to maintain dependencies and deploy, though it
can be overkill for many projects...</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://augeas.net/">Augeas</a> is not Python specific and supports
many configuration formats</li>
</ul>
<p>Ulrich then went through some of Martin Fowler's principles for
refactoring among other things, and also talked about Jenkins, not
Python but known as the &quot;Wordpress of Continuous Integration&quot; because it
has so many plugins. <a class="reference external" href="http://www.sonarsource.org/">Sonar</a> can be used
for code quality.</p>

<p>We tried something different for the second part of the evening and
watched a video of a Pyramid talk. I don't think it quite worked, even
at 30 minutes it felt too long. Perhaps we should try again with a video
more likely to appeal to a wider range of people, or simply shorter
talks. Fair play to Diarmuid for standing up and taking the heat of
answering questions afterwards ;)</p>
