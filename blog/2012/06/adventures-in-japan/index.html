</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>In the middle of May, I went away for a couple of weeks in lovely
Fukuoka, Japan with the goal of expanding my knowledge of Japanese.</p>
<p>Every weekday, I went to a language school,
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.genkijacs.com">GenkiJACS</a>. On the first day, my level was
accurately evaluated through a written test and interview, and on the
same afternoon I was put into a small class (5 people, myself included)
with students at a similar level from all over the world. The lessons
were held entirely in Japanese, with students' chitchat also happening
in Japanese -- a lovely atmosphere :)</p>
<p>Support from the staff, both by email during the preceding months and
during my stay, was top notch. The school also offers all sorts of
native language materials for students to borrow, though considering the
building was right above Mandarake, a manga/video games/DVD/etc shop, I
must say I mostly bought my own... :)</p>
<p>I stayed with a host family for the whole time, which was wonderful in
terms of language practice, making friends and experiencing varied
aspects of Japanese daily life. The perceived lack of independence made
me a bit twitchy at times though.</p>
<p>The concepts and vocabulary I learnt in and out of class have stuck well
so far -- the class format is very good, with lots of reviewing after a
new concept is introduced. In the end though, 2 weeks isn't enough time
to acquire that much new knowledge and I mostly treat the experience as
a very thorough level check. There are lots of conversations I had I
didn't realise were within my grasp. Because Japanese people are often
reluctant or unable to speak English (but always so nice and helpful!),
I had plenty of opportunities to practice in varied contexts and I'm now
a lot less shy about speaking in Japanese.</p>
<p>With only 2 weeks, unfortunately there was little time for tourism,
though what I saw of Fukuoka City (Canal City, Kushida shrine and many
other temples, Oohori Park, my local yakitori izakaya and kappazushi...)
and the Fukuoka Prefecture (Dazaifu, Abura yama...) was delightful.</p>
<p>Definitely a wonderful experience. Study-wise, it was good for building
confidence and boosting motivation. It was also good for cheaply
acquiring plenty of contents in the language for practice... and making
new friends! :)</p>
