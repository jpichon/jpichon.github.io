</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>With <a href="https://shipitcon.com/">ShipItCon</a> 2024 fast approaching (in 2 days!!), it's time for me to
admit I will never finish writing up my notes from last year's and just post
what I do have. Perhaps this year my note-taking skills will improve?</p>
<p>ShipItCon is a small non-profit conference in Dublin that focuses on Software
Delivery. The conference is a single track on a single day, and the theme in
2023 was "The Unknown" (observability came up A LOT!). Here are of a few of the
highlights, from my perspective (and from my very, very partial notes).</p>
<p>The <a href="https://shipitcon.com/recordings/?_sfm_year=2023">2023 recordings</a> are available now.</p>
<h2>Keynote: Dr Norah Patten</h2>
<p>Inspiring journey to become Ireland's first astronaut! Also very
impressive and massive amount of outreach work. Including writing a
children's book, <a href="https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/fbb5ee56-d40e-48f3-b2d2-34c7e84493e0">Shooting for the Stars</a>!</p>
<p>I liked how she broke down several stages of her life into categories:
Influences (e.g. teachers, family) / Role models / Peers / Experience
(e. g. a visit to NASA as a child), and how each contributed and came
together to allow her to come to where she is, now.</p>
<p>Some cool outreach projects I didn't know about:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanoracks">Nanoracks</a>, students plan experiments for astronauts then examine
  the results.</li>
<li><a href="https://possum13.org/about/">PoSSUM 13</a> for researchers, and the microgravity challenge for payload
  experiments in space/suborbital/microgravity. High school students apply with
  detailed plans of the science experiment they want to run, and if successful
  get to build the payload themselves with mentoring, etc.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What's Slowing Your Team Down? (Laura Tacho)</h2>
<p>After observing hundreds of teams, the speaker found that every team has the
same problems, divided into three categories: projects, processes, people.</p>
<p>The speaker uses thousands of metrics to determine issues. Tracking doesn't
solve the problem but it helps with tracking progress as well as "quantify
sentiment" which I found really interesting. In general, I found this talk
incredibly informative and valuable, and I recommend the recording.</p>
<p><strong>1. Projects</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Too much work in progress</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the biggest problems for most teams. It causes issues with getting
things done or finishing things.</p>
<p>Measures that can help: number of projects per person (engineer cognitive
load), ...</p>
<ul>
<li>Lack of prioritisation</li>
</ul>
<p>No means "not now"; yes means "forever" (with an every increasing maintenance
cost).</p>
<p>The goal should be specific enough that teams can easily say no to things.</p>
<p><strong>2. Process</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Slow feedback (from people or machines)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not enough focus time</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Length and frequency of focus time chunks, number of meetings where something
is actually at stake, ...</p>
<p><strong>3. People</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Unclear expectations</li>
</ul>
<p>Giving expectations vs fear of micromanagement.
<br/>Receiving expectations vs fear of seeming incompetent, psychologically
unsafe teams.
<br/> (How this can set up a negative circle where one lead to the other and
back)</p>
<p>Reading recommendations: "Accelerate" (about DORA metrics), the SPACE of
Developer Productivity, <a href="https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=3595878">DevEx: What Actually Drives Productivity</a>
(interesting, although at least one of the main author is selling something
related).</p>
<p>I imagine the recording is available now, and the <a href="https://shipitcon.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2-Laura-Tacho-Whats-Slowing-Your-Team-Down_-ShipItCon-2023.pptx">slides</a> are also
interesting for a more detailed summary with many more examples of measures for
each category, and a link to the kind of developer survey they used to
"quantify sentiment."</p>
<h2>Building scalable GenAI Retrievial Augmented Generation Platforms (Mihai Criveti)</h2>
<p>LLM and their limitations. Text generation, doesn't learn from interactions, AI
function to predict the next word, doesn't access the Internet.</p>
<p>Models with 70 billions parameters cost $20k/month dedicated GPU instance on
Amazon.</p>
<p><a href="https://shipitcon.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/3-Mihai-Criveti-Retrieval-Augmented-Generation-v3.pdf">Slides</a> with more information on this works and the limitations the speaker
found.</p>
<h2>How to Make Your Automation a Better Team Player (Laura Nolan)</h2>
<p>This felt particularly relevant to my work. The talk was really engaging
because the speaker always links every issue back to famous incidents or
incidents she personally experienced. The <a href="https://shipitcon.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/4-Laura-Nolan-Making-your-Automation-a-Better-Team-Player.pptx">slides</a> also include these
examples.</p>
<p>"Joint Cognitive Systems" where computers and humans collaborate on cognitive
work.</p>
<p>Paper recommendation: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ironies_of_Automation">Ironies of Automation</a> by Lisanne Bainbridge. 40yo
paper and these problems still haven't been solved!</p>
<p>The problem described is like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>The easy stuff is automated first</li>
<li>New people only ever learn the hard stuff, and develop a partial
   mental model of how things work</li>
<li>Life becomes harder for operators because they need to learn both
   how things work + how the automation works.</li>
</ol>
<p>We are doing a bad job if the operator can shoot themselves in the foot with
our tools.</p>
<p>Two anti-patterns to avoid!</p>
<p><strong>1. Automation surprises</strong></p>
<p>Automation through using a lot of scripts, tools, cronjobs is hard to
manage. Centralising into a self-running/autonomous automation helps, where
possible.</p>
<p>The behaviour should be as simple and as predictable as possible.</p>
<p>Unattended upgrades are a bad idea, silent and deadly.</p>
<p>Incident examples (although there are many! Linked in the slides, all
informative):</p>
<ul>
<li>A <a href="https://firefish.social/notes/9iqefgi8rzfksnqc">routine GitOps operation</a> (link now defunct :() that caused a
  namespace to be deleted when ArgoCD system lost visibility on the yaml,
  bringing down the entire site.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/2023-03-08-multiregion-infrastructure-connectivity-issue/">Unattended upgrade disaster</a> at DataDog</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Recommendation systems (e.g. to assist in troubleshooting.)</strong></p>
<p>They make it harder to generate alternative hypothesis. Using softer language
may help, like "in the past, problems like this were caused by X."</p>
<p>Tools as amplifiers: help with understanding systems, as opposed to providing
suggestions. They shouldn't hide complexity. Help operators to build a mental
model of the system.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://shipitcon.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/4-Laura-Nolan-Making-your-Automation-a-Better-Team-Player.pptx">slides</a> include links to more advice and lots of incident examples.</p>
<hr>
<p>And that's it, because the talks were too interesting and I'm apparently unable
to be concise when taking notes. The conference is really excellent at inviting
deeply knowledgeable, deeply interesting speakers, and I'm looking forward to
the next one. Thankfully I won't have to wait long ;)</p>
