</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>The monthly Open-Source night experiment continues. On Wednesday, June
19th we had the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.tog.ie/2013/06/open-source-night-june/">June edition of Open-Source
Night</a>.
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.technomancy.org/">Rory</a> gave us a
slightly-longer-than-15-minutes talk on
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.openstreetmap.org">OpenStreetMap</a>, and the kind of
contributions the project welcomes (data data data, really!). I was the
only one to volunteer for a lightning talk, in stark contrast with the
last event where we had multiple ones both by people attending
open-source night and network people who happened to be visiting the
hackerspace at the time.</p>
<p>Rather than doing an on-topic talk about an open-source project, I did a
meta-talk about Open-Source Night itself and different ways in which it
could evolve.</p>
<p>I make no secret that I don't think open-source night works very well in
its current format. My goal (and measure for success) is to help people
actually get started contributing.</p>
<p>Note: if you were at my <a class="reference external" href="http://thedotconf.wordpress.com/whos-speaking/julie-pichon/">deep dive on contributing to
open-source</a>
and planning on attending the next open-source night, please do come!!
This all just means that I think there are things that can be improved
:)</p>
<div class="section" id="reminder-the-current-format">
<h2>Reminder: The current format</h2>
<p>We're currently meeting on the 3rd Wednesday of the month. The event
usually starts with two 15 minutes talk, ideally one on the life of
open-source (e.g. licences, version control, IRC, using the
command-line...) and one on how to contribute to a specific project.
Then there's a number of 5-minutes-long-or-less lightning talks where
people can introduce the project they will be working on during the
evening. Then people break into groups or independently work on an
open-source project of their choice.</p>
<p>Or that's the idea anyway. The talks usually work well and are
inspiring, though they tend to run overtime and then people have trouble
sitting at a table and doing things.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-future">
<h2>The future</h2>
<p>These are my thoughts and ideas as to where open-source night might go
in the future. These are not plans. I would like to hear feedback from
interested people - attendees, would-be attendees, other organisers and
thoughtful passerbys.</p>
<div class="section" id="topics-general-open-source-vs-project-specific">
<h3>Topics: General open-source vs Project-specific</h3>
<p>I see value in both topics, but perhaps attendees and would-be attendees
favour one or the other, both, or neither? I haven't really heard much
on this, what people find most useful. I think the project specific
talks at least are interesting for both newcomers and established
contributors, to see how other projects do things.</p>
<p>I believe 15 minutes is a good amount of time to get an overview, get
inspired and get ideas. And not get too bored if already familiar with
the topic.</p>
<p>I could see the value and how efficient it would be to focus on one
project for a full session and guide people through contributing to it.
However I can also see how it could be offputting to people not
particularly interested in the project (e.g. &quot;I don't use that distro,
why should I bother attending?&quot;). Perhaps as separate, off-shoot events
if people are interested in leading that kind of session (get in
touch!).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="topics-all-kind-of-contributions-vs-focusing-on-code">
<h3>Topics: All kind of contributions vs Focusing on code</h3>
<p>At the moment, I try really hard to emphasise (and encourage speakers to
do the same) all the kinds of contributions that can be made - and are
well needed! - even though my own experience lies in code-based
contributions. Maybe I should give up on being inclusive and focus on
what I know best, rather than try to be all things to all people?
Code-focused open-source events could go from learning to program to
fixing a bug.</p>
<p>Initially I was hoping people would step up to talk and encourage people
to join their area of interest (I think we have e.g. experienced
open-source translators around...) but that hasn't happened.</p>
<p>This is actually a point where someone came up to me after the talk and
said straight off they really liked the breadth of contributions demoed
during the talks, in particular mentioning <a class="reference external" href="http://www.tog.ie/2013/05/open-source-night-may/">last month's
talk</a> by Guilherme
on <a class="reference external" href="http://openmandriva.org">OpenMandriva</a> that did a great job
showing how someone can help, in a multitude of ways, even if they're
not all that confident in their coding skills.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="format-more-course-like">
<h3>Format: More course-like?</h3>
<p>A couple of days before the June OSS Night I was pointed to <a class="reference external" href="http://opensource.com/life/13/6/learning-program-open-source-way">this
article on a really, really interesting summer course on learning to
program the open-source
way</a>.
That's a really cool concept. Should we entertain the thought of doing
something similar during open-source night? e.g. A session on learning
how to use version control with exercises, very workshop like, one
month, some other topic the next one, etc.?</p>
<p>Probably not, but something to consider as a separate course with a
shorter timeline. A course with one session a month will lose people and
have little momentum. Is this the kind of things people have an interest
in learning?</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="format-doing-vs-listening-talking">
<h3>Format: Doing vs Listening/Talking</h3>
<p>My goal with this event is still to get people started contributing. I'm
not interested in organising a monthly night of talks. Finding speakers
is stressful. If the talks aren't followed by some contributing action,
to me the event is failing and I'm not interested in continuing to
organise it. There are plenty of events around Dublin already where
people can meet, talk tech and shoot the breeze.</p>
<p>With regard to open-source related talks, I think that's already handled
well by the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.linux.ie">ILUG</a> folks, who are now keen to
set them up regularly again under the new chairmanship :) And we can
join forces if that's the most attractive part of the event to folks. If
your main interest is in having a regular night of open-source talks,
get in touch and I'll be happy to help you have this in Tog. I'd attend
with pleasure anyway, I'm just not interested in organising it and go
speaker-hunting every 3 weeks.</p>
<p>I still believe we can make something really cool happen by putting in
the same room people experienced in open-source together with newcomers
interested in contributing. So I'm not giving up yet!</p>
<p>There's of course also the timeframe issue: with or without talks, an
evening of maybe 3 hours is not a lot of time to accomplish something.
Maybe we could (also/instead?) have events on Saturdays? And/or week-end
workshops, Friday eve to Sunday?</p>
<p>HOWEVER, in any case an evening is still enough time to accomplish
<em>something</em>, get started, get the momentum going, get unblocked and
finish your contribution later at the week-end, in your own time.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="you-why-are-you-here-anyway">
<h3>You: Why are you here anyway*? ;)</h3>
<p>* Or why weren't you? :) I'm just as interested in the answer to that!</p>
<p>Are you interested in learning how to contribute? Interested in helping
and mentoring newcomers? What were you hoping this evening would be
about?</p>
<p>I then invited people to have a productive discussion with me about this
should they wish to, somewhat contradicting my own doing vs talking rant
:-)</p>
<p>Please feel free and welcome to continue the discussion in the comments
or <a class="reference external" href="https://www.jpichon.net/about/">by email</a>, I would love to pick
more brains and exchange ideas about this.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="django-challenge">
<h3>Django challenge</h3>
<p>To avoid the talk being entirely meta (and in case people didn't care
that much about all the blah blah blah and more about the doing!), I
issued a challenge to attendees as well: this evening, run the
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.djangoproject.com">Django</a> unit tests suite. If that's
something you're set up for, it'll take 2 minutes. If you're familiar
with the concept but don't have all the dependencies set up yet it'll
take 20 minutes. If this is all new to you it might take 2 hours, but
what you learn you'll be able to reuse when you start working on a
project you care about in the future, and it means it'll take less long
then.</p>
<p>One person took me up on it and it took them 10 minutes. This shows how
possible it is to actually get the ball rolling during open-source
night, get people to realise they're not that far away from a first
contribution.</p>
<p>I feel I should give the disclaimer that since the last time I talked
about how to contribute to Django, the Django folks added to their docs
a <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.5/intro/contributing/">tutorial on how to make your first
contribution</a>,
which just makes the project that little bit more awesome (and this
challenge, easier to solve!)</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="next-open-source-night-july">
<h2>Next Open-Source Night: July</h2>
<p>So next month. That'll be on the 17th of July. Are you interested in
giving a talk? :)</p>
<p>If no one volunteers we'll have a session similar to the first event
except with more lightning talks. Lightning talks don't have to be
prepared, there's no need for slides or anything you don't fancy. It's
as simple as chatting about what you plan on doing or would like to do
during the evening, inviting others to join you if they'd like.</p>
<p>It can be like:</p>
<p>&quot;Hello, I'm Chris, a contributor to AwesomeProject which is a project
that does this and that and also that thing. At the moment we're looking
for help in $area1, $area2, $area41, if you think that's cool and you'd
like to help, I'll be sitting at that table over here, come and chat
with me. Maybe I can help you find a good first task. Otherwise I'll be
working on the defroglirnator for the project -- er if you have any
experience in that area I'd love to chat to you too.&quot;</p>
<p>or maybe</p>
<p>&quot;Hey, I'm J. Bloggs, I've been using Wordpress for a few years, I think
it's an awesome project and I'd like to start giving back. Tonight my
plan is to figure out the new contributor process - if you're interested
too, we can do this together. Come and chat with me.&quot;</p>
<p>It doesn't matter if there is no existing contributor to the specific
project in the room. Since there are people familiar with the way
open-source projects and communities usually tick, they will be able to
help you if you get stuck.</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br /></div>
</div>
<p>Ok, that's it! I'm hoping to also have the time to find a few good first
tasks in a new project, maybe
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.libreoffice.org/">LibreOffice</a>. If not, then we can
figure it out together on the day :)</p>
<p>I'm very much looking forward to hearing your thoughts, suggestions and
ideas about all this, and perhaps also see you on the 17th.</p>
