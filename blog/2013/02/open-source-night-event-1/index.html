</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>On Wednesday, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.tog.ie">Tog</a> hosted the first monthly
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.tog.ie/2013/01/one-small-step-open-source-night/">Open-Source
Night</a>.</p>
<p>It's an event I'd been wanting to organise for a while, with an eye on
it being hands-on and slanted toward helping interested people get
started in open-source, but I wasn't sure what format would work best.
I'm still not sure, but in the spirit of release early, release often, I
thought I'd give it a shot for a few months and iterate.</p>
<p>For the first event, about a dozen people showed up. About 7-9 of them
had already made some kind of contribution, most people had a clear idea
of the project they wanted to contribute to for the evening, and 3 were
hesitant and not sure what they wanted to do.</p>
<p><a class="reference external image-reference" href="https://www.jpichon.net/site_media/images/2013/opensourcenight_blackboard.jpg"><img alt="Blackboard with project names" src="https://www.jpichon.net/site_media/images/2013/opensourcenight_blackboard-small.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>We started with 2 super short talks, an ill-prepared one from myself
about what to do tonight: basically find the contributor's guidelines
for the project you're interested in and speak to the person next to you
for help, since we had such a skewed ratio of experienced contributors.
<a class="reference external" href="http://scienceisdelicious.com/">Triona</a> followed with a talk on what
she planned to do in the evening with <a class="reference external" href="http://free-penguin.org/">Free
Penguin</a>, an open-source sewing pattern for
Tux plushes. The maintainer hasn't updated nor responded to emails in
years, so it seems it will need to be forked in order to start improving
the documentation. Open-source projects aren't all about code! :)</p>
<p>I directed the hesitant project-less people toward
<a class="reference external" href="http://chebe.dreamwidth.org/">Cheryl</a> and the
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.dreamwidth.org/">Dreamwidth</a> project, which has an
excellent reputation for <a class="reference external" href="http://www.linuxplanet.com/linuxplanet/reports/6939/1">being friendly to
newcomers</a>.
Even without an experienced contributor around, I thought figuring
things out together would be a fun learning experience. It may not have
been that effective though, people were interested and looked around but
nothing got accomplished (perhaps that is to be expected for a first
couple of hours getting acquainted with a project and open-source?).
Then further efforts were thwarted by technical problems (bugzilla
down). Cheryl's thoughts abut this is that it's difficult to get into a
project one doesn't feel strongly about (a similar downside applies to
projects discovered via <a class="reference external" href="http://openhatch.org">OpenHatch</a>, as someone
else mentioned to me).</p>
<p>There were a couple of serendipitous meetings, like the person wanting
to get started with Debian packaging who happened to be sitting besides
a Debian Developer.</p>
<p>But overall, I think having encouraged people to come along already
having a project in mind made it difficult to form groups and encourage
collaboration, because people ended up working on the project they had
planned to alone. It may not have been a great experience, particularly
for people who didn't know anyone or hadn't been in Tog before.</p>
<p>I also need to become more familiar with projects who have good,
specific non-programming-related tasks for newcomers. I had a general
idea but wasted time trying to find the details. We had a graphic
designer interested in either contributing his design skills,
translating or participating in testing efforts but I wasn't able to
quickly find a good &quot;Here's a concrete task you can do now&quot; for some of
the better known projects. He did discover InkScape and became eager to
learn it, so I hope to see him again in Tog in a few weeks for teaching
an intro workshop to InkScape :-) (Thanks Borud!!)</p>
<div class="section" id="ideas-on-how-to-evolve-the-format-for-next-time">
<h2>Ideas on how to evolve the format for next time:</h2>
<p>Choose one project and make it the main focus of the evening, at least
at the start. Meaning only one presentation, that is a bit longer
(ideally 20 minutes, max 30 -- we still need time to actually do stuff!)
and give specific, step-by-step instructions on &quot;this is where you go to
find something to work on, this is how you choose a task&quot; and afterwards
have the people interested in working on the project do so together -
several people to one task can work, to encourage learning together and
avoid getting stuck. People are still welcome to work on whatever else
they want to of course. This was suggested by
<a class="reference external" href="http://spamt.net/">Ulrich</a> based on the recent Debian Bug Squashing
Parties he attended.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://eirebecky.wordpress.com/">Becky</a> said there was an interest
in a GitHub pair programming type of exercise. People upload code on
GitHub they never touch again. Working on someone else's code with the
help of the author could turn into an instructive experience. It would
also be cool to see what a pull request looks like from both sides.</p>
<p>I think we can try both these things for next time, the GitHub pair
programming could start after the presentation for people not interested
in working on the highlighted project.</p>
<p>Now. The next step is to find a project to highlight and a willing
contributor who'd like to present and guide, for the next session on
March 20th. Ideas, volunteers? :)</p>
<p>Feedback and general thoughts on evolving the format are warmly welcome
as well.</p>
