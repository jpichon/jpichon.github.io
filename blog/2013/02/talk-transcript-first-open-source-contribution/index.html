<p>Most of you know what Open Source Software is and hopefully think it's
awesome. Have you ever contributed a patch? A translation? A bug report?
Would you like to do any of this?</p>
<p>(If this is the first time you hear the term, roughly open-source is
software for which the source code is freely available, that can be
redistributed and modified.)</p>
<p>This talk is for people who like open-source and would like to give
back, but are not sure where to start, or if they're smart enough or if
their skills would be valued.</p>
<p>And my goal is to encourage you to make the jump from 0 to 1
contribution (or one more!) :)</p>
<p>Because I'm a software developer, this talk focuses a bit more on code
contributions. (Don't think this means other types of contributions
aren't needed, help is always welcome everywhere!) For many years, I
wasn't strongly attached to any particular project but got patches in
here and there (<a class="reference external" href="http://sugarlabs.org/">Sugar</a>,
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.gnome.org/">Gnome</a>,
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a>...) Nowadays you're more
likely to find me in the land of
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.openstack.org">OpenStack</a>.</p>
<p>First, let's clarify something important: you don't need to be a genius
to contribute. It's not as difficult as it may initially appear. All
skill levels and all types of skills are needed and appreciated.</p>
<p>As to where to start, first I'm going to tell you about a wonderful
shortcut, and then I'll go through how it usually works.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.openhatch.org">OpenHatch</a> is an organisation whose
mission statement is: &quot;helping newcomers find their way into free
software projects.&quot; They aim to bring together all the simple bugs, help
requests and help wanted, documentation, all sorted by project and by
language. It's a great way to get started.</p>
<p>Now, the way it usually works. When you're looking to contribute to a
project, you should first look around for contributor guidelines. If a
project has contributor guidelines, it's an excellent sign. It means
that they care and that they've thought about it, which is very
important when it comes to first contributions.</p>
<p>Read them! You don't have to remember it all. It will give you a sense
of direction and an idea of what matters for the project, what to watch
out for too (patch format, coding conventions, where/who to talk to,
etc.)</p>
<p>As an example, here's a screenshot of the <a class="reference external" href="https://live.gnome.org/GnomeLove">Gnome documentation for new
contributors</a>. There's a lot in
there! They care a lot about welcoming new people.</p>
<p>In any case, whether a project has contributor guidelines or not, the
workflow tends to be the same. Read the guidelines if they exist :) From
then on, look at the bug tracker to find something that you'd be
interested in working on. Now that you know which part of the project
you will be working on, build it. Find the bug, fix it and submit your
patch!</p>
<p>I'm going to be using the first contribution I made to Gnome as an
example throughout this presentation. The Gnome folks are a very
friendly community, and have a special tags for bugs that are good for
newcomers called &quot;gnome-love&quot;. In other projects this may be called
&quot;easy picking&quot;, &quot;bite-sized&quot;, &quot;low hanging fruit&quot;, etc... It should be
mentioned in the contributor guidelines.</p>
<p>Look at the list of bugs tagged with that keyword and find one you like
that is easy. (Avoid choosing a big feature as a first contribution. You
need to earn some trust first, as well as pick up the project technical
and cultural conventions.)</p>
<p>Once you know what you will be working on, it's time to build the
software. This is very important, you will be learning new tools,
perhaps even new languages. For instance I chose a bug from
gnome-terminal which is written in C and uses autotools, which I wasn't
very familiar with. This is why it's important to select a small first
bug, because you have a lot more to learn to get there.</p>
<p>If you can't find instructions to build the software, you have a couple
of solutions. Sometimes a mentor comes together with the &quot;easy pickings&quot;
tag, or the community has its own mentorship program. You can also go
back to the magical portal mentioned earlier, OpenHatch, where &quot;training
missions&quot; are available to get people up to speed with some of tools
commonly used in open-source.</p>
<p>People forget they had to learn all this in the first place. Don't sweat
it. This is a stepping stone.</p>
<p>Once you have a working build, it's time to reproduce the bug, find it
and fix it! If you're lucky, the location of the bug may have been
mentioned in the bug report. As said earlier, the person who marked the
bug as an easy task may be willing to help mentor you through it. It's
ok to ask for help if you're having trouble.</p>
<p>As an example of a first task, I was lucky, and I indeed picked a very
simple one - changing a colour in the gnome terminal!</p>
<p>Once your fix is ready and tested (you have rebuilt the software with
your fix in it), it's time to submit the patch. Now is a good time to
refer yourselves to the contributor guidelines once again, it will be
useful to find out what your patch should look like (coding guidelines),
what command you should use to create the patch, and where you should
send it. If there are no such instructions, the safest path is to attach
the patch to the bug report in the tracker.</p>
<p>And... congratulations! You've made your first contribution to
open-source. Take the time to pat yourself in the back and be proud, you
deserve it.</p>
<p>The process isn't quite finished yet: the next step is to wait. Perhaps
your patch will be accepted since it's a small contribution. It's just
as likely you might get some feedback on how to improve it - everybody
wants to make their project better so don't take it personally, take the
feedback on-board and resubmit the patch. If your patch gets lost in the
ether, you should consider pinging the component or project maintainer.</p>
<p>In my case... I was lucky :) The patch was accepted and merged in the
main codebase about an hour later!</p>
<p>If the only answer you get is silence - don't take it personally,
really. People want you to stay, a healthy project know they need new
people in order to stay alive. Open-source projects are always short in
resources.</p>
<p>If the people involved in the project you contributed to have a bad
attitude, don't be discouraged. And don't stick around either, there are
a ton of cool, useful projects with friendly communities who could use
your contributions. Life's too short.</p>
<p>If you've done your research, read the guidelines, there won't be any
dragons. Most people are very nice! It's great to become part of a
community that cares about creating the most awesome project they can.</p>
<p>And as a closing word before opening for questions: remember
OpenHatch.org. They are people dedicated to helping newcomers find their
way.</p>
