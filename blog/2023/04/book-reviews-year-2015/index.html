</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <h2>Gateway (Heechee Saga, #1) by Frederik Pohl</h2>
<p>I was going to give this book only 4 stars because I didn't always like the main character and others, but then I realised: I never stopped believing in them or their personality, it is all consistently well-written all along and many very human personality aspects are explored in fascinating ways, like fear and cowardice and courage.<br/><br/>The premises are as follow: humanity found an asteroid with spaceships that they don't really understand nor control, and brave pioneers embark on them hoping to be brought to places with interesting new technology or knowledge (or just as likely die along the way).<br/><br/>The book reads very well (sometimes a concern with older sci-fi books) and tells a story at multiple levels, with the main character grudgingly undergoing therapy in the current day while recalling his time on Gateway. There are also tidbits of lectures, fake ads and other things from space interspersed that all come together to create a world and a story that I couldn't help finding compelling.<br/><br/>Updated to add: Reading a few other reviews, folks have a point though: if it's the same main character through the series, no matter how much more I'd like to learn about this world and universe it makes reading the other books a much less appealing prospect.</p>
<h2>The White Road (Nightrunner, #5) by Lynn Flewelling</h2>
<p>Overall a much more pleasant read than the previous book. Having Micum back and learning more about this world, in particular the Hazadrielfaie, was a treat. The ending left me somewhat ambivalent though the possibilities for more nightrunning in the following book are promising.</p>
<h2>The Machine Stops  by E.M. Forster</h2>
<p>Eerie short story, with many unexpected echoes to the present (despite being published in... 1909?!) and possible futures, where we rely too much on technology and tend to devalue -if not downright despise- our fellow humans.</p>
<h2>L'Enchanteur by René Barjavel</h2>
<p>Un conte doux et chaleureux, plein de joies simples, qui explore les légendes arthuriennes de façon merveilleuse et donne envie de recommencer à croire en la magie.<br/></p>
<h2>Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore (Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore, #1) by Robin Sloan</h2>
<p>Probably a good book, but it didn't connect with me at all. The majority of the characters felt flat, fitting one stereotype and never stepping outside of these boundaries to become a three-dimensional, well-rounded person-like character. You have The Artist, The Rich Young Entrepreneur, The Cute Nerd Woman, The Archaeology Enthusiast, and so on... But no one who comes out of the page. I wasn't a big fan of the Silicon Valley tech mindset permeating the story either, the unrelenting worship of Google and glorification of the start-up culture. Maybe it'd have been more fun to read in 10 years as a snapshot of how things used to be. For me, there wasn't much escapism in here, and only a small amount of curiosity regarding the main mystery.</p>
<h2>Ancillary Sword (Imperial Radch, #2) by Ann Leckie</h2>
<p>It took me a while to remember all the subtleties of the world, but once I did I found the story and new characters very engaging. It was nice to see concepts, history, etc that were only briefly touched on in the previous book detailed a bit more, and even if the story happens at a somewhat smaller scale than in the previous book the politics of it are interesting.<br/><br/>Also, spaceships.</p>
<h2>Player Piano by Kurt Vonnegut Jr.</h2>
<p>Another book that is probably very good but I just couldn't get into, quite probably due to the depression and hopelessness infusing every page. Particularly depressing when the world described in the story isn't such a big step from where we're at and going toward today. What happens when machines are deemed more important and valuable than people?</p>
<h2>Casket of Souls (Nightrunner, #6) by Lynn Flewelling</h2>
<p>Finally, a return to the series' nightrunning roots: intrigues, conspiracies, war, plots, cabals, nobles, parties, spying, and did I mention the nightrunning? The style remains as pleasantly unpretentious as before, the humour is still present and it is a pleasure to spend time again with these fully fleshed out, multi-dimensional characters.</p>
<h2>Shards of Time (Nightrunner, #7) by Lynn Flewelling</h2>
<p>Sad that this is the last book in the series but it certainly does justice to it! This time with an additional zest of mysterious possibly-ghosts messing with things, in addition to the usual rich characters, relationships, politics and wonderful worldbuilding.</p>
<h2>The Martian by Andy Weir</h2>
<p>I was concerned before starting this book that because it was so heavy on the science it would be about as entertaining as reading a textbook. My concerns turned out to be woefully unfounded. Right from the start, Mark's situation and (clever) fight for survival pulls you right in, and once other perspectives get added in the story gets even more gripping.</p>
<h2>No.6, Volume 1 by Atsuko Asano</h2>
<p>私たちの世界とさほど変わらない世界で、読みやすい、社会に疑問を投げかけるSF物語。キャラクター、友情、世界観や社会観が、全部面白かったです。</p>
<h2>Making Sense of Japanese: What the Textbooks Don't Tell You by Jay Rubin</h2>
<p>A great little collection of funny, useful essays about various Japanese grammar points. I think this book deserves a space on most Japanese learners' bookshelf because it is easy to read, unlike many grammar books out there (not that these aren't necessary as well). It's a different way to approach some of the troublesome aspects of the language and may help one reach the hah-ah moment they were waiting for.<br/><br/>Losing one star only due to the examples being in romaji and therefore quite hard to read for the longer ones (maybe it's easier if your vocabulary base is more solid?). Even without examples though, this remains an incredibly helpful book.</p>
<h2>妖怪アパートの幽雅な日常 1 by Hinowa Kouzuki</h2>
<p>妖怪アパートは面白いアイデアですが、結局あまり好きではない話になってしまいました。上から目線で、道徳者ぶっているように感じました。最初から主人公は大人と会話をすることだけで性格が変わってきます。ちょっとありえないと思いました。<br/><br/>私が思ったより、若い読者を対象にした本かもしれません。 </p>
<h2>１３歳のシーズン (BOOK WITH YOU) (Japanese Edition) by Atsuko Asano</h2>
<p>十代の若者についてのほのぼのとした話。</p>
<h2>No.6, Volume 2 by Atsuko Asano</h2>
<p>I really enjoyed it.</p>
<h2>No.6, Volume 3 by Atsuko Asano</h2>
<p>I really enjoyed it.</p>
<h2>赤い指 [Akai yubi] (加賀恭一郎, #7) by Keigo Higashino</h2>
<p>やはりおもしろかったです。もちろんあの話自体はどこか悲しいんですけど、筋立ては素晴らしく書いてあったと思います。人物の苦しさを感じました。<br/><br/>その上、認知症、家族への愛情、少年犯罪など、他の興味深いテーマがたくさん登場しました。</p>
<h2>No.6, Volume 4 by Atsuko Asano</h2>
<p>I really enjoyed it.</p>
<h2>Je suis un zèbre by Tiana</h2>
<p>Un témoignage émouvant.</p>
<h2>No.6, Volume 5 by Atsuko Asano</h2>
<p>今回の冊で、ある章はホラーすぎで読みがたいと思っても、脚注を読むとそれが「事実に基づいて書かれた話」と気づいてとても落ち込みました。人類には想像できないほどむごい所があるのですね。<br/><br/>これ以外には面白い作品でした。意外な場所で生死について哲学のような話が出てきて自分の考え方を問われるようになります。ネズミと紫苑の関係が少しずつ変化したり明らかになったりして面白かったのです。</p>
<h2>Ancillary Mercy (Imperial Radch, #3) by Ann Leckie</h2>
<p>Another enjoyable journey through the Radchaai universe. The story centres again strongly on politics, while also taking a closer look at the Artificial Intelligences hanging around. I found the Presger Translator fascinating, constantly being one thought away from understanding her logic... but then not.</p>
<h2>No.6, Volume 6 by Atsuko Asano</h2>
<p>ようやくその世界や人物についての事実が少しずつ出てきます。</p>
<h2>L'Adulte surdoué:Apprendre à faire simple quand on est compliqué (Psychologie) (French Edition) by Monique de Kermadec</h2>
<p>Une perspective intéressante sur des gens qui pensent et perçoivent le monde un peu différemment. Les exhortations constantes à consulter un thérapeute spécialisé donnent parfois une impression "infopub" un peu agaçante.</p>
